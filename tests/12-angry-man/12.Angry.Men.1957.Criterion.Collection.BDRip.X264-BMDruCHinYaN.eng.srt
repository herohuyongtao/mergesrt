1
00:01:18,781 --> 00:01:21,485
You did a wonderful job. Wonderful.

2
00:01:23,497 --> 00:01:25,570
You did it. You did it!

3
00:01:28,917 --> 00:01:34,207
To continue, you've listened to a long and
complex case, murder in the first degree.

4
00:01:34,297 --> 00:01:39,339
Premeditated murder is the most serious
charge tried in our criminal courts.

5
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:44,137
You've listened to the testimony, had the
law interpreted as it applies in this case.

6
00:01:44,225 --> 00:01:48,934
It's now your duty to sit down and try
and separate the facts from the fancy.

7
00:01:49,022 --> 00:01:53,268
One man is dead.
Another man's life is at stake.

8
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:57,403
If there's a reasonable doubt in your
minds as to the guilt of the accused -

9
00:01:57,489 --> 00:02:02,316
a reasonable doubt-then you must
bring me a verdict of not guilty.

10
00:02:02,410 --> 00:02:06,455
If there's no reasonable doubt,
then you must, in good conscience,

11
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:09,456
find the accused guilty.

12
00:02:09,542 --> 00:02:13,409
However you decide,
your verdict must be unanimous.

13
00:02:13,506 --> 00:02:16,955
In the event that
you find the accused guilty,

14
00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:20,335
the bench will not entertain
a recommendation for mercy.

15
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:23,680
The death sentence is mandatory
in this case.

16
00:02:24,058 --> 00:02:28,303
You are faced with a grave responsibility.
Thank you, gentlemen.

17
00:02:29,604 --> 00:02:32,890
The alternate jurors are excused.

18
00:02:37,405 --> 00:02:39,895
The jury will now retire.

19
00:05:00,302 --> 00:05:03,137
- Wanna piece of gum?
- No, thanks.

20
00:05:03,473 --> 00:05:06,045
This thing isn't movin'.

21
00:05:08,813 --> 00:05:12,477
- I'll give you a hand.
- That's it.

22
00:05:17,238 --> 00:05:20,605
You know somethin'? I called
the Weather Bureau this morning.

23
00:05:20,698 --> 00:05:23,699
This is gonna be
the hottest day of the year.

24
00:05:23,787 --> 00:05:26,454
You'd think they'd air-condition this place.

25
00:05:26,539 --> 00:05:29,787
- What is your name, sir?
- Oh, it's... that one. Yeah.

26
00:05:29,876 --> 00:05:34,039
Thank you very much.
OK, gentlemen. Everybody's here.

27
00:05:34,130 --> 00:05:39,289
Now, if there's anything you want,
I'll be right outside the door. Just knock.

28
00:05:51,899 --> 00:05:54,648
Good morning.
I never knew they locked the door.

29
00:05:54,733 --> 00:05:57,768
Sure they lock the door.
What'd you think?

30
00:05:57,862 --> 00:06:00,982
I don't know. It just never occurred to me.

31
00:06:01,824 --> 00:06:05,774
- What's that for?
- I thought we might wanna vote by ballot.

32
00:06:05,871 --> 00:06:10,033
Great idea. Maybe we can
get him elected senator.

33
00:06:15,881 --> 00:06:19,712
- How'd you like it?
- I don't know. It was pretty interesting.

34
00:06:19,803 --> 00:06:24,547
- Yeah? I almost fell asleep.
- I mean, I've never been on a jury before.

35
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:27,212
No? I've sat on many juries.

36
00:06:28,351 --> 00:06:33,726
Those lawyers talk and talk, even when
it's an open-and-shut case like this one.

37
00:06:33,816 --> 00:06:37,398
- Ever hear so much talk about nothin'?
- I guess they're entitled.

38
00:06:37,487 --> 00:06:40,736
They're entitled. It's the system, but...

39
00:06:40,825 --> 00:06:45,450
if you ask me, I'd slap those tough kids
down before they start any trouble.

40
00:06:45,536 --> 00:06:49,071
It saves a lot of time and money.
Let's get started.

41
00:06:49,165 --> 00:06:51,834
Yeah. We've probably all
got things to do here.

42
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:55,865
We can start with a five-minute break.
One gentleman is in the bathroom.

43
00:06:55,963 --> 00:06:58,040
Are... we gonna sit in order?

44
00:06:58,134 --> 00:07:00,837
Gee, I don't know. I guess so.

45
00:07:05,641 --> 00:07:08,131
- Buddy, you're in my seat.
- Oh, excuse me.

46
00:07:08,227 --> 00:07:10,300
That's all right.

47
00:07:11,563 --> 00:07:14,266
Hey, that's not a bad view, huh?

48
00:07:17,071 --> 00:07:21,648
What did you think of the case?
I mean, it had a lot of interest for me.

49
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:25,572
No real... dead spots.
You know what I mean?

50
00:07:25,661 --> 00:07:30,287
We were lucky to get a murder case.
I figured us for an assault or burglary.

51
00:07:30,374 --> 00:07:33,078
Boy, they can be the dullest!

52
00:07:34,171 --> 00:07:39,413
- Hey, is that the Woolworth Building?
- That's right.

53
00:07:39,509 --> 00:07:43,459
Isn't that funny? I've lived here all my life.
I've never been inside it.

54
00:07:43,556 --> 00:07:47,599
If you had to sort out all that junk,
like that thing with the movies.

55
00:07:47,683 --> 00:07:50,684
Yeah. What about
that business with the knife?

56
00:07:50,771 --> 00:07:53,806
Asking grown-up people
to believe that kind of jazz.

57
00:07:53,898 --> 00:07:56,650
You expect that.
You know what we're dealing with.

58
00:07:56,736 --> 00:07:58,394
Yeah, I guess so.

59
00:07:58,988 --> 00:08:01,988
Well, your horn works.
Now try your lights.

60
00:08:02,074 --> 00:08:06,073
- You got a cold?
- And how. Hot-weather colds can kill you.

61
00:08:06,163 --> 00:08:08,616
I can hardly touch my nose.
Know what I mean?

62
00:08:08,705 --> 00:08:11,409
Sure do. I just got over one.

63
00:08:12,252 --> 00:08:16,830
- Oh, come on! Mr Foreman, let's go.
- The guy's still in the bathroom.

64
00:08:16,923 --> 00:08:20,755
What's new? I didn't get a chance
to see a paper this morning.

65
00:08:20,842 --> 00:08:23,250
I was only wondering
how the market closed.

66
00:08:23,346 --> 00:08:27,841
- You got a seat on the exchange?
- I'm a broker.

67
00:08:27,933 --> 00:08:30,008
I run a messenger service.

68
00:08:30,105 --> 00:08:32,428
The Beck and Call Company.

69
00:08:32,522 --> 00:08:34,764
The name is my wife's idea.

70
00:08:34,859 --> 00:08:38,391
Got 37 men workin'. Started with nothin'.

71
00:08:38,486 --> 00:08:41,190
OK, men. Let's take our seats, huh?

72
00:08:44,826 --> 00:08:50,069
We can all get out of here pretty quick.
I have tickets to that ball game tonight.

73
00:08:50,166 --> 00:08:53,948
Yanks and Cleveland. We've got
this kid Modjelewski in there.

74
00:08:54,045 --> 00:08:56,333
He's a real bull, this kid. You know...

75
00:08:57,632 --> 00:08:59,753
Real jug-handled. You know?

76
00:09:02,470 --> 00:09:06,419
You're a real baseball fan, aren't ya?
Where do we sit here?

77
00:09:06,515 --> 00:09:09,549
I thought we'd sit in order,
by jury numbers.

78
00:09:09,643 --> 00:09:13,344
One, two, three and so on around the
table, if that's OK with you gentlemen.

79
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:16,523
- What's the difference?
- It's reasonable to sit in order.

80
00:09:16,609 --> 00:09:23,275
- Let it be.
- That's twelve. We go around one, two...

81
00:09:23,367 --> 00:09:27,445
What was your impression
of the prosecuting attorney?

82
00:09:27,538 --> 00:09:30,325
- I beg pardon?
- I thought he was really sharp,

83
00:09:30,417 --> 00:09:34,284
the way he handled all those points
one by one, in logical sequence.

84
00:09:34,379 --> 00:09:39,253
- I was very impressed.
- I think he... he did an expert job.

85
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:42,542
A lot of drive, too. You know? Real drive.

86
00:09:42,636 --> 00:09:46,088
OK, fellas. Can we
hold it down a minute? Fellas?

87
00:09:46,183 --> 00:09:48,340
Say, we'd like to get started.

88
00:09:48,436 --> 00:09:51,305
Gentleman at the window.

89
00:09:51,397 --> 00:09:54,562
- We'd like to get started.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

90
00:09:54,650 --> 00:09:59,690
- The kid kills his father, just like that.
- Listen, it happens all the time.

91
00:09:59,779 --> 00:10:02,067
They let those kids run wild up there.

92
00:10:02,157 --> 00:10:05,109
Well, maybe it serves him right.
You know what I mean?

93
00:10:05,203 --> 00:10:08,155
- Is everyone here?
- The old man is inside.

94
00:10:08,245 --> 00:10:10,997
- Would you knock on the door for him?
- Yeah.

95
00:10:12,084 --> 00:10:15,286
- Are you a Yankee fan?
- No, Baltimore.

96
00:10:15,671 --> 00:10:17,745
Baltimore?

97
00:10:18,466 --> 00:10:22,509
That's like being hit in the head
with a crowbar once a day.

98
00:10:22,596 --> 00:10:26,377
Who have they got? Who have they got
besides good groundkeepers?

99
00:10:26,473 --> 00:10:29,677
- Say, we'd like to get started.
- Forgive me, gentlemen.

100
00:10:29,769 --> 00:10:33,468
- I didn't mean to keep you waiting.
- Baltimore?

101
00:10:33,815 --> 00:10:39,604
OK, if I can have your attention. You fellas
can handle this thing any way you want.

102
00:10:39,696 --> 00:10:42,447
I'm... you know,
I'm not gonna make any rules.

103
00:10:42,532 --> 00:10:48,486
We can, well, discuss it first, then vote
on it. That's, of course... that's one way.

104
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:51,330
And, well, we can vote on it right now.

105
00:10:51,416 --> 00:10:54,168
I think it's customary
to take a preliminary vote.

106
00:10:54,253 --> 00:10:58,084
Yeah, let's vote. Who knows?
Maybe we can all get outta here.

107
00:10:59,634 --> 00:11:05,802
OK. Then I think that you know that we
have a first-degree murder charge here,

108
00:11:05,890 --> 00:11:11,015
and if we vote the accused guilty,
we've got to send him to the chair.

109
00:11:11,103 --> 00:11:13,723
Um... That's mandatory.

110
00:11:13,815 --> 00:11:16,850
- I think we know that.
- Yeah, let's see who's where.

111
00:11:16,943 --> 00:11:20,641
- OK. Anyone doesn't wanna vote?
- It's fine with me.

112
00:11:21,864 --> 00:11:27,239
OK, then, just remember that this
has to be twelve to nothing, either way.

113
00:11:27,328 --> 00:11:30,363
That's the law. OK, are we ready?

114
00:11:30,456 --> 00:11:33,992
All those voting guilty,
please raise your hands.

115
00:11:37,254 --> 00:11:41,251
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven...

116
00:11:42,178 --> 00:11:44,584
eight, nine, ten, eleven.

117
00:11:44,679 --> 00:11:47,169
OK, that's eleven guilty.

118
00:11:47,725 --> 00:11:49,800
Those voting not guilty?

119
00:11:50,269 --> 00:11:52,474
One. Right.

120
00:11:52,562 --> 00:11:57,353
Eleven guilty, one not guilty.
Well, now we know where we are.

121
00:11:57,443 --> 00:12:00,609
Boy, oh boy! There's always one.

122
00:12:01,948 --> 00:12:04,651
So, what do we do now?

123
00:12:04,743 --> 00:12:07,827
- I guess we talk.
- Boy, oh boy!

124
00:12:07,913 --> 00:12:10,829
You really think he's innocent?

125
00:12:13,458 --> 00:12:16,709
- I don't know.
- You sat in court with the rest of us.

126
00:12:16,797 --> 00:12:19,962
You heard what we did.
The kid's a dangerous killer.

127
00:12:20,049 --> 00:12:23,499
- He's 18 years old.
- Well, that's old enough.

128
00:12:23,594 --> 00:12:26,465
He stabbed his own father
four inches into the chest.

129
00:12:26,556 --> 00:12:29,224
They proved it
a dozen different ways in court.

130
00:12:29,309 --> 00:12:32,843
- Would you like me to list 'em for you?
- No.

131
00:12:33,148 --> 00:12:36,146
- Then what do you want?
- I just want to talk.

132
00:12:36,233 --> 00:12:39,399
What's there to talk about?
Eleven of us think he's guilty.

133
00:12:39,487 --> 00:12:41,811
No one had to think about it twice
except you.

134
00:12:41,905 --> 00:12:45,072
I want to ask you something.
Do you believe his story?

135
00:12:45,159 --> 00:12:49,453
- I don't know. Maybe I don't.
- So how come you voted not guilty?

136
00:12:49,539 --> 00:12:51,410
There were eleven votes for guilty.

137
00:12:51,497 --> 00:12:56,575
It's not easy to raise my hand and send a
boy off to die without talking about it first.

138
00:12:56,671 --> 00:13:00,204
- Well, now, who says it's easy?
- No one.

139
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:05,093
What? Just because I voted fast?
I honestly think the guy is guilty.

140
00:13:05,179 --> 00:13:07,848
Couldn't change my mind
if you talked for 100 years.

141
00:13:07,933 --> 00:13:10,636
I'm not trying to change your mind.
It's just that...

142
00:13:10,727 --> 00:13:13,845
This is somebody's life.
We can't decide in five minutes.

143
00:13:13,939 --> 00:13:18,351
- Supposing we're wrong?
- Supposing this building fell on my head?

144
00:13:18,443 --> 00:13:21,312
- You can suppose anything.
- That's right.

145
00:13:21,404 --> 00:13:26,446
What's the difference how long it takes?
Supposin' we take five minutes? So what?

146
00:13:26,535 --> 00:13:31,445
Let's take an hour. The ball game
doesn't start till eight o'clock.

147
00:13:36,212 --> 00:13:39,627
- Who's got something to say?
- /'m willing to sit for an hour.

148
00:13:39,715 --> 00:13:45,054
- Great. I heard a good story last night...
- That's not why we're sitting here.

149
00:13:45,138 --> 00:13:49,301
All right, then you tell me.
What are we sitting here for?

150
00:13:49,977 --> 00:13:52,762
I don't know. Maybe no reason.

151
00:13:52,853 --> 00:13:56,305
Look, this kid's been
kicked around all of his life.

152
00:13:56,401 --> 00:14:00,183
You know, born in a slum,
mother dead since he was nine.

153
00:14:00,278 --> 00:14:02,648
He lived for a year and a half
in an orphanage

154
00:14:02,739 --> 00:14:05,692
when his father was serving
a jail term for forgery.

155
00:14:05,782 --> 00:14:08,106
That's not a very happy beginning.

156
00:14:08,203 --> 00:14:11,868
He's a wild, angry kid. That's all
he's ever been. And you know why?

157
00:14:11,957 --> 00:14:15,824
Cos he's been hit on the head
by somebody once a day, every day.

158
00:14:15,921 --> 00:14:21,210
He's had a pretty miserable 18 years.
I think we owe him a few words, that's all.

159
00:14:21,299 --> 00:14:26,044
I don't mind telling you this, mister. We
don't owe him a thing. He got a fair trial.

160
00:14:26,138 --> 00:14:30,682
What do you think that trial cost?
He's lucky he got it. Know what I mean?

161
00:14:30,770 --> 00:14:35,062
Look, we're all grown-ups in here.
We heard the facts, didn't we?

162
00:14:35,147 --> 00:14:39,476
You're not gonna tell me we're supposed
to believe this kid, knowing what he is.

163
00:14:39,569 --> 00:14:41,810
I've lived among them all my life.

164
00:14:41,905 --> 00:14:47,195
You can't believe a word they say.
You know that. I mean, they're born liars.

165
00:14:47,287 --> 00:14:50,535
- Only an ignorant man can believe that.
- Now, listen...

166
00:14:50,622 --> 00:14:53,492
Do you think you were born
with a monopoly on the truth?

167
00:14:53,584 --> 00:14:56,371
Certain things should be
pointed out to this man.

168
00:14:56,462 --> 00:15:01,538
- It's not Sunday. We don't need a sermon.
- We have a job to do. Now let's do it.

169
00:15:01,633 --> 00:15:05,415
Rice Pops. It's a product
I work on at the agency.

170
00:15:05,512 --> 00:15:08,048
"The breakfast with the built-in bounce."

171
00:15:08,139 --> 00:15:10,511
- I wrote that line.
- Very catchy.

172
00:15:10,602 --> 00:15:15,263
- Say, do you mind?
- I'm sorry. I have this habit of doodling.

173
00:15:15,356 --> 00:15:18,309
- It keeps me thinking clearly.
- We have work to do.

174
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:21,484
There's no point
staying here for ever. OK.

175
00:15:22,030 --> 00:15:28,197
Perhaps if the gentleman down there who
is disagreeing with us could tell us why.

176
00:15:28,286 --> 00:15:32,330
Tell us what you're thinking. We might be
able to show you where you're mixed up.

177
00:15:32,416 --> 00:15:39,129
Maybe this is an idea. It seems to me that
it's up to us to convince this gentleman

178
00:15:39,213 --> 00:15:44,836
that he's wrong and we're right. Maybe if
we each took a couple of minutes just to...

179
00:15:44,928 --> 00:15:48,794
- Well, it was just a quick idea.
- No, no, no. That's a good one.

180
00:15:48,891 --> 00:15:50,928
Supposing we go once around the table?

181
00:15:51,141 --> 00:15:53,134
I guess you're first.

182
00:15:56,983 --> 00:15:59,554
It's hard to put into words.

183
00:16:00,403 --> 00:16:02,692
I just think he's guilty.

184
00:16:02,782 --> 00:16:06,563
I thought it was obvious from the word go.
Nobody proved otherwise.

185
00:16:06,659 --> 00:16:10,656
Nobody has to prove otherwise.
The burden of proof's on the prosecution.

186
00:16:10,747 --> 00:16:14,994
The defendant doesn't even have to open
his mouth. That's in the Constitution.

187
00:16:15,084 --> 00:16:19,330
Sure, I know that. What I meant was...

188
00:16:20,090 --> 00:16:23,789
Well... I just think he's guilty.
I mean, somebody saw him do it.

189
00:16:23,885 --> 00:16:29,128
OK. Here's what I think. And I have
no personal feelings about this.

190
00:16:29,225 --> 00:16:32,260
I just wanna talk about facts.

191
00:16:32,352 --> 00:16:34,758
Number one.

192
00:16:34,855 --> 00:16:39,065
The old man lived downstairs under
the room where the killing took place.

193
00:16:39,152 --> 00:16:42,852
At 10 minutes after 12 on the night
of the killing, he heard loud noises.

194
00:16:42,947 --> 00:16:45,021
Said it sounded like a fight.

195
00:16:45,116 --> 00:16:47,902
And he heard the kid yell out
"I'm gonna kill ya."

196
00:16:47,993 --> 00:16:50,317
A second later,
he heard a body hit the floor.

197
00:16:50,412 --> 00:16:54,825
Ran to the door, opened it up, saw the kid
run down the stairs and out of the house.

198
00:16:54,917 --> 00:16:58,831
Called the police. They found the old man
with the knife in his chest.

199
00:16:58,921 --> 00:17:02,171
The coroner fixed the time of death
around midnight.

200
00:17:02,259 --> 00:17:07,596
Now, these are facts.
You can't refute facts. The kid is guilty.

201
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:10,965
I'm just as sentimental as the next fella.
I know he's only 18.

202
00:17:11,059 --> 00:17:15,221
- But he's still gotta pay for what he did.
- I'm with you.

203
00:17:15,314 --> 00:17:19,179
- OK. Are you finished?
- Yeah.

204
00:17:19,276 --> 00:17:22,775
It is obvious to me that
the boy's entire story was flimsy.

205
00:17:22,862 --> 00:17:24,769
He claimed he was at the movies,

206
00:17:24,864 --> 00:17:28,815
yet he couldn't remember the names
of the films he saw or who played in them.

207
00:17:28,911 --> 00:17:31,696
- That's right.
- And no one saw him at the theatre.

208
00:17:31,788 --> 00:17:36,164
And the woman across the street-if her
testimony don't prove it, nothing does.

209
00:17:36,251 --> 00:17:40,712
- That's right. She actually saw the killing.
- Fellas, please. Let's go in order.

210
00:17:40,798 --> 00:17:42,874
Just a minute. Here's a woman...

211
00:17:44,219 --> 00:17:48,795
Here's a woman who's lying in bed.
She can't sleep. She's dyin' with the heat.

212
00:17:48,889 --> 00:17:51,973
She looks out the window,
and right across the street

213
00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:55,678
she sees the kid stick the knife
into his father.

214
00:17:55,773 --> 00:17:58,892
The time is 12.10 on the nose.
Everything fits.

215
00:17:58,984 --> 00:18:01,273
She's known the kid all his life.

216
00:18:01,362 --> 00:18:05,227
His window is opposite hers across the
el tracks. She swore she saw him do it.

217
00:18:05,322 --> 00:18:07,895
Through the windows
of a passing el train.

218
00:18:07,993 --> 00:18:12,240
This el train had no passengers on it.
It was just being moved downtown.

219
00:18:12,332 --> 00:18:15,665
The lights were out,
and they proved in court that at night

220
00:18:15,752 --> 00:18:19,583
you can look through the windows and
see what's happening on the other side.

221
00:18:19,672 --> 00:18:22,837
- They proved it.
- I'd like to ask you something.

222
00:18:22,924 --> 00:18:25,842
You don't believe the boy.
How come you believe the woman?

223
00:18:25,928 --> 00:18:29,177
She's one of "them" too, isn't she?

224
00:18:30,308 --> 00:18:34,222
- You're a pretty smart fella, aren't ya?
- OK, gentlemen. Now, gentlemen.

225
00:18:34,312 --> 00:18:38,604
- Come on, sit down. Sit down.
- What's he so wise about? I'm telling ya...

226
00:18:38,690 --> 00:18:41,975
Come on. Now we're not gonna
get anywhere fighting.

227
00:18:42,071 --> 00:18:46,317
- Whose turn is it next?
- Oh, his. Number five.

228
00:18:49,579 --> 00:18:52,152
May I... Can I pass?

229
00:18:52,248 --> 00:18:55,118
Well... That's your privilege.

230
00:18:55,209 --> 00:18:57,450
How about the next gentleman?

231
00:18:57,545 --> 00:19:00,117
Oh. Well... I don't know.

232
00:19:00,214 --> 00:19:04,874
I started to be convinced,
you know, very early in the case.

233
00:19:04,968 --> 00:19:08,171
You see, I was looking for a motive.

234
00:19:08,264 --> 00:19:13,804
That's very important because if you don't
have a motive, where's your case, right?

235
00:19:13,895 --> 00:19:19,646
Anyway, that testimony from those people
across the hall from the kid's apartment,

236
00:19:19,733 --> 00:19:25,155
that was very powerful. Didn't they say
something about a fight, an argument,

237
00:19:25,239 --> 00:19:29,533
between the old man and his son
around about seven o'clock that night?

238
00:19:29,619 --> 00:19:32,951
- I could be wrong but...
- It was eight o'clock, not seven.

239
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:38,828
They heard an argument. Then
they heard the father hit the boy twice.

240
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:43,167
Finally they saw the boy run, angry,
out of the house. What does that prove?

241
00:19:43,259 --> 00:19:46,258
It don't prove anything.
It's just part of the picture.

242
00:19:46,346 --> 00:19:49,511
You said it provided a motive.
So did the prosecution.

243
00:19:49,599 --> 00:19:51,719
That wasn't a very strong motive.

244
00:19:51,809 --> 00:19:55,722
This boy has been hit so many times
that violence is practically...

245
00:19:55,814 --> 00:19:58,139
It's a normal state of affairs with him.

246
00:19:58,231 --> 00:20:02,477
I just can't see two slaps in the face
provoking him into committing murder.

247
00:20:02,570 --> 00:20:07,112
It may have been two too many.
Everyone has a breaking point.

248
00:20:08,410 --> 00:20:10,698
Anything else?

249
00:20:10,786 --> 00:20:14,155
- No.
- OK. How about you?

250
00:20:16,751 --> 00:20:20,166
I don't know. It's all been said.

251
00:20:20,254 --> 00:20:23,705
You can talk here for ever.
It's still the same thing.

252
00:20:24,092 --> 00:20:28,969
This kid is five for 0.
Well, look at his record.

253
00:20:29,058 --> 00:20:33,349
When he was 10, he was in children's
court: He threw a rock at a teacher.

254
00:20:33,435 --> 00:20:37,515
When he was 15, he was
in reform school: He stole a car.

255
00:20:37,607 --> 00:20:42,433
He's been arrested for muggin'.
He was picked up twice for knife fightin'.

256
00:20:42,528 --> 00:20:47,236
They say he's real handy with a knife.
Oh, this is a very fine boy.

257
00:20:47,325 --> 00:20:51,868
Ever since he was five, his father
beat him up regularly. He used his fists.

258
00:20:51,955 --> 00:20:54,446
So would I. A kid like that?

259
00:20:54,541 --> 00:20:57,873
It's these kids -
the way they are nowadays.

260
00:21:00,130 --> 00:21:03,829
When I was a kid,
I used to call my father "sir".

261
00:21:03,925 --> 00:21:07,091
That's right. Ever hear a kid
call his father that any more?

262
00:21:07,177 --> 00:21:10,546
Fathers don't seem to think
it's important any more.

263
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:13,047
- You got any kids?
- Three.

264
00:21:14,102 --> 00:21:16,176
I got one.

265
00:21:17,104 --> 00:21:19,180
He's 22 years old.

266
00:21:24,864 --> 00:21:29,324
When he was nine years old,
he ran away from a fight.

267
00:21:29,410 --> 00:21:34,200
I saw it. I was so embarrassed,
I almost threw up.

268
00:21:34,290 --> 00:21:39,746
I said "I'm gonna make a man out of you
if I have to break you in two tryin'."

269
00:21:41,339 --> 00:21:44,043
Well, I made a man out of him.

270
00:21:44,133 --> 00:21:46,837
When he was 16, we had a fight.

271
00:21:48,096 --> 00:21:51,215
Hit me in the jaw. He was a big kid.

272
00:21:53,769 --> 00:21:56,722
I haven't seen him for two years.

273
00:21:59,150 --> 00:22:01,224
Kids.

274
00:22:01,652 --> 00:22:03,726
You work your heart out...

275
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:09,774
- Well, let's get goin'.
- I think we're missing the point.

276
00:22:09,869 --> 00:22:13,532
This boy's the product of a broken home
and a filthy neighbourhood.

277
00:22:13,622 --> 00:22:17,120
We can't help that. We're here
to decide his innocence or guilt,

278
00:22:17,210 --> 00:22:20,163
not to go into the reasons
why he grew up the way he did.

279
00:22:20,255 --> 00:22:24,797
He was born in a slum.
Slums are breeding grounds for criminals.

280
00:22:24,883 --> 00:22:30,339
It's no secret that children from slums
are potential menaces to society. I think...

281
00:22:30,431 --> 00:22:34,643
You can say that again. The kids who
crawl out of these places are real trash.

282
00:22:34,729 --> 00:22:40,150
- I don't want any part of them.
- Listen, I... I've lived in a slum all my life.

283
00:22:40,234 --> 00:22:42,059
- Wait a minute.
- Please. I...

284
00:22:42,152 --> 00:22:45,104
I've played in back yards
that were filled with garbage.

285
00:22:45,196 --> 00:22:47,982
- Maybe you can still smell it on me.
- Listen, sonny...

286
00:22:48,074 --> 00:22:50,445
Come on, now. There's nothing personal.

287
00:22:50,535 --> 00:22:54,119
Come on, fella. He didn't mean you.
Let's not be so sensitive.

288
00:22:54,207 --> 00:22:56,911
This sensitivity I can understand.

289
00:22:57,002 --> 00:23:01,829
OK, look. Let's stop the arguing.
We're only wasting time.

290
00:23:01,922 --> 00:23:04,412
Your turn down there. Let's go.

291
00:23:05,510 --> 00:23:09,423
I didn't expect a turn. I thought
you were all gonna to try to convince me.

292
00:23:09,513 --> 00:23:11,719
- That was the idea.
- I forgot. He's right.

293
00:23:11,808 --> 00:23:15,139
He's the one keeping us in here.
Let's hear what he's got to say.

294
00:23:15,226 --> 00:23:19,094
Wait. We decided to do this a certain way.
I think we ought to stick to it.

295
00:23:19,191 --> 00:23:21,478
Oh, stop being a kid, will ya?

296
00:23:21,567 --> 00:23:26,229
- What do you mean, a kid?
- What do you think I mean? K-I-D: Kid.

297
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:31,450
Just because I'm trying
to keep this organised?

298
00:23:31,536 --> 00:23:35,747
Here, you take on the responsibility.
I'll just keep my mouth shut.

299
00:23:35,833 --> 00:23:39,201
- Why are you gettin' so hot? Calm down.
- Don't tell me to calm down.

300
00:23:39,294 --> 00:23:41,666
You want to take the chair?
Take the chair.

301
00:23:41,756 --> 00:23:44,127
Did you ever see such a thing?

302
00:23:44,216 --> 00:23:47,548
- You think it's funny?
- Forget it, fella. It's unimportant.

303
00:23:47,636 --> 00:23:49,544
Unimportant? Here, you try it.

304
00:23:49,638 --> 00:23:52,757
Nobody wants to change.
You're doing a beautiful job.

305
00:23:52,851 --> 00:23:58,474
Yeah, you're doin' great. Just great, fella.
You stay in there and pitch.

306
00:23:58,566 --> 00:24:02,181
All right, let's hear from somebody.

307
00:24:02,276 --> 00:24:06,438
Well, if you want me to tell you
how I feel about it, it's all right with me.

308
00:24:06,530 --> 00:24:11,489
- Boy, I don't care what you do.
- All right. I don't have anything brilliant.

309
00:24:11,577 --> 00:24:13,736
I only know as much as you do.

310
00:24:13,831 --> 00:24:17,494
According to the testimony,
the boy looks guilty. Maybe he is.

311
00:24:17,583 --> 00:24:22,292
I sat there in court for six days
listening while the evidence built up.

312
00:24:22,381 --> 00:24:24,456
Everybody sounded so positive.

313
00:24:24,549 --> 00:24:29,459
I began to get a peculiar feeling about
this trial. I mean, nothing is that positive.

314
00:24:29,555 --> 00:24:33,968
There are questions I'd have liked to ask.
Maybe they wouldn't mean anything but...

315
00:24:34,060 --> 00:24:38,851
I felt that the defence wasn't conducting
a thorough enough cross-examination.

316
00:24:38,938 --> 00:24:41,855
He let too many things go by-little things.

317
00:24:41,943 --> 00:24:44,776
What little things?
When they don't ask questions,

318
00:24:44,861 --> 00:24:47,777
it's because they know
the answers already.

319
00:24:47,866 --> 00:24:52,777
It's also possible for a lawyer to be just
plain stupid, isn't it? I mean, it's possible.

320
00:24:52,870 --> 00:24:55,953
You sound like you met
my brother-in-law once.

321
00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:04,328
I kept putting myself in the kid's place.
I'd have asked for another lawyer, I think.

322
00:25:04,424 --> 00:25:06,832
I mean, if I was on trial for my life,

323
00:25:06,927 --> 00:25:11,920
I'd want my lawyer to tear the prosecution
witnesses to shreds, or at least try to.

324
00:25:12,017 --> 00:25:16,262
Look, there was one alleged
eyewitness to this killing.

325
00:25:16,354 --> 00:25:19,886
Someone else claims he heard the killing,
saw the boy run out after,

326
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:22,187
and there was circumstantial evidence.

327
00:25:22,278 --> 00:25:26,225
But those two witnesses
were the entire case for the prosecution.

328
00:25:26,322 --> 00:25:27,780
Supposing they're wrong?

329
00:25:27,866 --> 00:25:31,198
What do you mean? What's the point
of having witnesses at all?

330
00:25:31,285 --> 00:25:35,662
- Could they be wrong?
- Those people were under oath.

331
00:25:35,747 --> 00:25:39,746
They're only people. People
make mistakes. Could they be wrong?

332
00:25:39,836 --> 00:25:42,919
- Well, no. I don't think so.
- Do you know so?

333
00:25:43,006 --> 00:25:46,456
Nobody can know a thing like that.
This isn't an exact science.

334
00:25:46,551 --> 00:25:49,041
That's right, it isn't.

335
00:25:53,057 --> 00:25:55,548
OK, let's get to the point.

336
00:25:55,644 --> 00:25:58,762
What about the switch knife
they found in the old man's chest?

337
00:25:58,854 --> 00:26:02,057
Some people haven't talked yet.
Shouldn't we go in order?

338
00:26:02,151 --> 00:26:05,732
They'll get a chance to talk.
Be quiet a second, will ya?

339
00:26:05,821 --> 00:26:10,483
What about the knife this fine, upright boy
admitted buying the night of the killing?

340
00:26:10,576 --> 00:26:14,192
- Let's talk about it.
- All right. Let's get it in here and look at it.

341
00:26:14,287 --> 00:26:19,329
- I'd like to see it again. Mr Foreman?
- Why do we have to see it again?

342
00:26:19,420 --> 00:26:23,036
The gentleman has a right
to see exhibits in evidence.

343
00:26:23,757 --> 00:26:27,089
- Say, could you bring us the knife?
- The knife? Sure.

344
00:26:28,427 --> 00:26:32,045
The knife and the way it was bought
is strong evidence, don't you think?

345
00:26:32,139 --> 00:26:35,970
- I do.
- Good. Let's take the facts one at a time.

346
00:26:36,061 --> 00:26:39,477
One: The boy admitted leaving the house
at eight o'clock at night

347
00:26:39,565 --> 00:26:41,771
after being slapped by his father.

348
00:26:41,860 --> 00:26:46,735
No, he didn't say "slapped".
He said "punched". There's a difference.

349
00:26:46,822 --> 00:26:49,359
After being hit several times by his father.

350
00:26:49,449 --> 00:26:53,447
Two: He went directly to a local junk shop
where he bought one of those...

351
00:26:53,536 --> 00:26:55,944
- Switch knives.
- Switchblade knives.

352
00:26:56,042 --> 00:27:00,748
This wasn't an ordinary knife. It had
a very unusual carved handle and blade.

353
00:27:00,836 --> 00:27:05,378
The storekeeper said it was the only one
of its kind he had ever had in stock.

354
00:27:05,465 --> 00:27:10,709
Three: He met some friends of his in front
of a tavern about 8.45. Am I right so far?

355
00:27:10,806 --> 00:27:12,842
- Yes, you are.
- You bet he is.

356
00:27:12,931 --> 00:27:16,382
He talked with his friends
for an hour, leaving them at 9.45.

357
00:27:16,478 --> 00:27:19,265
During this time,
they saw the switch knife.

358
00:27:19,356 --> 00:27:26,236
Four: They identified the death weapon
in court as that very same knife.

359
00:27:26,321 --> 00:27:29,155
Five: He arrived home
at about ten o'clock.

360
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:33,534
This is where the stories offered
by the State and the boy diverge slightly.

361
00:27:33,620 --> 00:27:36,111
He claims that he went to a movie
at about 11.30,

362
00:27:36,208 --> 00:27:40,500
returning home at 3.10 to find
his father dead and himself arrested.

363
00:27:40,586 --> 00:27:44,665
He also claims that the two detectives
threw him down a half a flight of stairs.

364
00:27:44,757 --> 00:27:48,623
What happened to the knife? He claims
it fell through a hole in his pocket

365
00:27:48,719 --> 00:27:52,467
on the way to the movies,
sometime between 11.30 and 3.10,

366
00:27:52,558 --> 00:27:56,223
and that he never saw it again.
Now, there is a tale, gentlemen.

367
00:27:56,311 --> 00:27:59,593
I think it's clear the boy
never went to the movies that night.

368
00:27:59,688 --> 00:28:03,473
No one in the house saw him go out.
No one at the theatre identified him.

369
00:28:03,568 --> 00:28:06,852
He couldn't even remember
the names of the pictures he saw.

370
00:28:08,572 --> 00:28:10,565
What actually happened is this.

371
00:28:10,659 --> 00:28:13,943
The boy stayed home,
had another fight with his father,

372
00:28:14,036 --> 00:28:17,536
stabbed him to death and left the house
at 10 minutes after 12.

373
00:28:17,625 --> 00:28:20,411
He even wiped the knife
clean of fingerprints.

374
00:28:20,503 --> 00:28:24,914
Are you trying to tell me that this knife
fell through a hole in the boy's pocket,

375
00:28:25,006 --> 00:28:27,378
someone picked it up,
went to the boy's house

376
00:28:27,468 --> 00:28:30,421
and stabbed his father with it
just to test its sharpness?

377
00:28:30,513 --> 00:28:32,753
No, but it's possib/e the boy lost his knife

378
00:28:32,849 --> 00:28:35,933
and somebody else stabbed his father
with a similar knife.

379
00:28:36,019 --> 00:28:38,508
Take a look at this knife.

380
00:28:39,522 --> 00:28:41,728
It's a very unusual knife.

381
00:28:41,816 --> 00:28:46,062
I've never seen one like it. Neither had
the storekeeper who sold it to the boy.

382
00:28:46,153 --> 00:28:49,401
Aren't you asking us to accept
an incredible coincidence?

383
00:28:49,491 --> 00:28:54,284
- I'm just saying a coincidence is possible.
- And I say it's not possible.

384
00:29:00,085 --> 00:29:02,040
Where did that come from?

385
00:29:02,128 --> 00:29:04,914
- It's the same knife!
- What do you think you're doin'?

386
00:29:05,005 --> 00:29:08,706
- Where did you get it?
- I went out walking last night.

387
00:29:08,803 --> 00:29:10,877
Through the boy's neighbourhood.

388
00:29:10,972 --> 00:29:16,262
I bought that at a pawn shop two blocks
from the boy's house. It cost six dollars.

389
00:29:16,351 --> 00:29:19,102
It's against the law
to buy or sell switchblade knives.

390
00:29:19,187 --> 00:29:22,389
- That's right. I broke the law.
- You pulled a real bright trick.

391
00:29:22,482 --> 00:29:24,973
Now supposing you tell me what it proves.

392
00:29:25,070 --> 00:29:28,318
- Maybe there are ten knives like that.
- Maybe there are!

393
00:29:28,406 --> 00:29:33,400
What does it mean? You found a knife like
it. What's that? The discovery of the age?

394
00:29:33,494 --> 00:29:37,705
You think somebody else did the stabbing
with exactly the same kind of knife?

395
00:29:37,790 --> 00:29:40,790
- The odds are a million to one.
- It's possible!

396
00:29:40,877 --> 00:29:45,039
- But not very probable.
- OK, fellas. Let's take our seats.

397
00:29:45,131 --> 00:29:48,666
There's no point standing around
all over the place.

398
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:52,461
It's interesting that he'd find a knife
exactly like the boy's.

399
00:29:52,558 --> 00:29:57,134
- What's interesting about it? Interesting!
- I just thought it was interesting.

400
00:29:57,227 --> 00:29:59,552
Eleven of us still think he's guilty.

401
00:29:59,646 --> 00:30:03,477
Right. You're not gonna
change anybody's mind.

402
00:30:03,568 --> 00:30:05,855
If you wanna hang this jury, go ahead.

403
00:30:05,945 --> 00:30:10,109
The kid'll be tried again
and found guilty, as sure as he's born.

404
00:30:10,449 --> 00:30:12,570
You're probably right.

405
00:30:12,660 --> 00:30:15,495
So, what are you gonna do?
We can be here all night.

406
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:18,864
It's only one night. A boy may die.

407
00:30:18,957 --> 00:30:21,708
Well, why don't we just
set up house here?

408
00:30:21,793 --> 00:30:24,119
Someone send for a pinochle deck

409
00:30:24,215 --> 00:30:27,877
and we'll just sweat
the whole thing out right here.

410
00:30:27,967 --> 00:30:31,799
- I don't think he oughta joke about it.
- What do you want me to do about it?

411
00:30:31,889 --> 00:30:35,007
I don't see what the knife
has got to do with anything.

412
00:30:35,101 --> 00:30:38,017
Somebody saw the kid stab his father.
What more do we need?

413
00:30:38,104 --> 00:30:40,938
You guys can talk the ears
right off my head.

414
00:30:41,024 --> 00:30:45,565
I got three garages going to pot.
So let's get done and get outta here.

415
00:30:45,652 --> 00:30:49,234
The knife was important to the
district attorney. He spent a day...

416
00:30:49,325 --> 00:30:52,158
He's a 15th assistant or something.
What does he know?

417
00:30:52,243 --> 00:30:56,536
Let's hold it down. These side arguments
are only slowin' us up.

418
00:30:58,374 --> 00:31:01,740
- Well, what about it?
- You're the only one.

419
00:31:09,135 --> 00:31:15,304
I have a proposition to make to all of you.
I'm going to call for another vote.

420
00:31:15,392 --> 00:31:18,178
I want you eleven men to...

421
00:31:18,270 --> 00:31:20,676
vote by secret written ballot.

422
00:31:21,148 --> 00:31:25,773
I'll abstain. If there are eleven votes
for guilty, I won't stand alone.

423
00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:30,771
We'll take in a guilty verdict
to the judge right now.

424
00:31:30,866 --> 00:31:36,072
But if anyone votes not guilty,
we'll stay here and talk it out.

425
00:31:37,958 --> 00:31:42,784
- That's it. If you want to try it, I'm ready.
- All right. Let's do it the hard way.

426
00:31:42,878 --> 00:31:46,711
That sounds fair. Everyone agreed?
Anyone doesn't agree?

427
00:31:46,799 --> 00:31:48,873
OK, pass these along.

428
00:32:21,710 --> 00:32:23,785
Guilty.

429
00:32:25,588 --> 00:32:27,246
Guilty.

430
00:32:29,010 --> 00:32:30,668
Guilty.

431
00:32:32,305 --> 00:32:33,962
Guilty.

432
00:32:35,183 --> 00:32:36,842
Guilty.

433
00:32:38,228 --> 00:32:39,886
Guilty.

434
00:32:41,522 --> 00:32:43,182
Guilty.

435
00:32:43,691 --> 00:32:45,350
Guilty.

436
00:32:46,362 --> 00:32:48,020
Guilty.

437
00:32:52,118 --> 00:32:54,109
Not guilty.

438
00:32:54,203 --> 00:32:55,742
Guilty.

439
00:32:55,829 --> 00:32:59,992
- Boy, how do you like that?
- And another chap flips his wings!

440
00:33:00,082 --> 00:33:02,917
All right. Who was it?
Come on, I wanna know.

441
00:33:03,003 --> 00:33:06,667
Excuse me. This was a secret ballot.
We all agreed on that, no?

442
00:33:06,756 --> 00:33:09,211
If the gentleman
wants it to remain secret...

443
00:33:09,302 --> 00:33:14,888
Secret? What do you mean? There are no
secrets in a jury room. I know who it was.

444
00:33:14,975 --> 00:33:19,221
Brother, you really are somethin'.
You vote guilty like the rest of us,

445
00:33:19,312 --> 00:33:22,514
then some golden-voiced preacher
tears your heart out -

446
00:33:22,607 --> 00:33:25,891
some underprivileged kid
couldn't help becoming a murderer -

447
00:33:25,985 --> 00:33:29,732
and you change your vote.
If that isn't the most sickening...

448
00:33:29,823 --> 00:33:33,274
Why don't you drop a quarter
in his collection box?

449
00:33:33,367 --> 00:33:38,029
Oh, now just wait a... Listen, you can't talk
to me like that. Who do you think you are?

450
00:33:38,122 --> 00:33:40,907
Calm down, calm down. It doesn't matter.

451
00:33:40,999 --> 00:33:44,618
- He's very excitable. Sit down.
- Excitable? You bet I'm excitable!

452
00:33:44,713 --> 00:33:48,045
We're tryin' to put a guilty man
in the chair, where he belongs.

453
00:33:48,134 --> 00:33:51,834
Someone starts tellin' us
fairy tales and we're listenin'!

454
00:33:52,513 --> 00:33:57,423
- What made you change your vote?
- He didn't change his vote. I did.

455
00:33:57,518 --> 00:33:59,508
- Oh, fine.
- I knew it.

456
00:33:59,602 --> 00:34:03,470
- Would you like me to tell you why?
- No, I wouldn't like you to tell me why.

457
00:34:03,566 --> 00:34:07,645
- I'd like to anyway, if you don't mind.
- Do we have to listen to this?

458
00:34:07,737 --> 00:34:11,235
- The man wants to talk.
- Thank you.

459
00:34:11,324 --> 00:34:14,693
This gentleman has been
standing alone against us.

460
00:34:14,786 --> 00:34:17,025
He doesn't say the boy is not guilty.

461
00:34:17,123 --> 00:34:22,033
He just isn't sure. It's not easy to stand
alone against the ridicule of others.

462
00:34:22,127 --> 00:34:26,870
So he gambled for support and I gave it
to him. I respect his motives.

463
00:34:26,965 --> 00:34:31,628
The boy on trial is probably guilty,
but... I want to hear more.

464
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:35,384
The vote is ten to two. I'm talking!
You have no right to leave this room!

465
00:34:35,473 --> 00:34:38,758
He can't hear you. He never will.
Let's sit down.

466
00:34:43,941 --> 00:34:47,985
- Shall we continue?
- Well, I think we ought to take a break.

467
00:34:48,070 --> 00:34:52,698
You know, one man's inside and
I think we ought to wait for him.

468
00:34:55,451 --> 00:34:58,285
Looks like we're really
hung up here, huh?

469
00:34:58,370 --> 00:35:02,868
I mean, that thing with the old man,
that was pretty unexpected.

470
00:35:02,961 --> 00:35:06,577
Wish I could figure out some way
we could break it up.

471
00:35:08,426 --> 00:35:13,002
You know, in advertising...
I told you I worked in an agency?

472
00:35:13,096 --> 00:35:16,929
Some pretty strange people work there.
Well, not strange, really.

473
00:35:17,017 --> 00:35:21,310
I guess it's just they have peculiar ways
of expressing themselves.

474
00:35:21,397 --> 00:35:24,397
I suppose it's the same
in your business too, huh?

475
00:35:24,483 --> 00:35:27,020
- What do you do?
- I'm a watchmaker.

476
00:35:27,111 --> 00:35:31,238
Really? I imagine the finest watchmakers
in the world come from Europe.

477
00:35:31,323 --> 00:35:34,323
Anyway, in an agency,
when we reach a point like this...

478
00:35:34,411 --> 00:35:38,241
I'm telling him, in an ad agency when
a point like this is reached in a meeting,

479
00:35:38,330 --> 00:35:41,448
there's always some character
ready with an idea, see.

480
00:35:41,543 --> 00:35:43,950
It kills me. It's the weirdest thing,

481
00:35:44,045 --> 00:35:47,081
the way they sometimes precede
their idea with a phrase.

482
00:35:47,173 --> 00:35:50,873
Like, some account exec
will get up and he'll say:

483
00:35:50,969 --> 00:35:57,302
"OK, here's an idea. Let's... run it up
the flagpole and see if anyone salutes it."

484
00:35:57,392 --> 00:35:59,929
I mean, it's idiotic, but it's funny.

485
00:36:00,020 --> 00:36:03,636
I... got a little excited back there.

486
00:36:03,732 --> 00:36:06,685
I... didn't mean to get nasty.

487
00:36:08,028 --> 00:36:13,365
Glad you're not one of those who lets
these emotional appeals influence him.

488
00:36:28,465 --> 00:36:31,170
I don't know what's the matter
with that fan.

489
00:36:40,937 --> 00:36:44,186
- Are you a salesman?
- I'm an architect.

490
00:36:46,902 --> 00:36:49,736
You know what the soft sell is?

491
00:36:52,115 --> 00:36:55,150
Well, you've got it, believe me.

492
00:36:55,659 --> 00:36:58,197
I've got a different technique.

493
00:36:58,289 --> 00:37:02,238
Laughs, drinks, jokes, tricks. You know?

494
00:37:03,251 --> 00:37:05,327
Yeah.

495
00:37:05,963 --> 00:37:09,378
Hit 'em where they live-that's my motto.

496
00:37:09,466 --> 00:37:13,166
I made 27 grand last year
sellin' marmalade.

497
00:37:13,262 --> 00:37:16,844
That's not bad. I mean, you know,
considerin' marmalade.

498
00:37:18,976 --> 00:37:21,681
What are you gettin' out of this? Kicks?

499
00:37:22,441 --> 00:37:26,138
Or did somebody bump you on the head
once and you haven't gotten over it?

500
00:37:26,233 --> 00:37:30,562
- Maybe.
- You know, you do-gooders are all alike.

501
00:37:30,654 --> 00:37:35,280
You're always blowin' your stacks
over some guy that fanned.

502
00:37:36,496 --> 00:37:39,198
But what are you wastin' our time for?

503
00:37:39,290 --> 00:37:44,793
Why don't you donate five dollars to the
cause? Maybe it'll make you feel better.

504
00:37:46,463 --> 00:37:48,619
This kid is guilty, pal.

505
00:37:48,715 --> 00:37:53,507
It's as plain as the nose on your face. So
why don't we stop wastin' our time here?

506
00:37:53,595 --> 00:37:56,466
We're gonna all get sore throats
if we keep it up.

507
00:37:56,558 --> 00:38:00,388
What difference does it make
if you get it here or at the ball game?

508
00:38:00,477 --> 00:38:02,884
No difference, pal.

509
00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:05,056
No difference at all.

510
00:38:16,745 --> 00:38:21,703
- Nice bunch of guys, huh?
- They're about the same as anyone else.

511
00:38:21,791 --> 00:38:24,280
Boy, what a murderous day.

512
00:38:24,711 --> 00:38:28,459
- Do you think we'll be much longer?
- I don't know.

513
00:38:28,549 --> 00:38:32,249
He's guilty for sure.
Not a doubt in the whole world.

514
00:38:32,345 --> 00:38:36,092
We should've...
We should've been done already.

515
00:38:37,015 --> 00:38:39,422
Oh, I don't mind, you know.

516
00:38:39,519 --> 00:38:41,593
Beats workin'.

517
00:38:47,944 --> 00:38:52,438
- You think he's not guilty, huh?
- I don't know. It's possible.

518
00:38:52,531 --> 00:38:56,577
Well, I don't know you, but I'm bettin'
you've never been wronger in your life.

519
00:38:56,661 --> 00:38:59,068
You're wastin' your time.
You ought to wrap it up.

520
00:38:59,163 --> 00:39:02,034
Supposing you were the one
who was on trial?

521
00:39:02,125 --> 00:39:05,373
Well, I'm not used to supposin'.
I'm just a workin' man.

522
00:39:05,461 --> 00:39:08,412
My boss does the supposin'. But...

523
00:39:08,505 --> 00:39:10,582
I'll try one.

524
00:39:11,384 --> 00:39:14,835
Supposin' you talk us all out of this and...

525
00:39:14,931 --> 00:39:18,762
the kid really did knife his father, huh?

526
00:39:26,025 --> 00:39:28,064
Are you ready?

527
00:39:29,528 --> 00:39:31,602
Sorry, blue eyes.

528
00:39:32,322 --> 00:39:35,442
- Well, where else?
- OK, fellas. Let's take our seats.

529
00:39:35,535 --> 00:39:40,196
- Looks like we'll be here for dinner.
- OK, now let's get down to business.

530
00:39:40,289 --> 00:39:42,114
- Who wants to start?
- I will.

531
00:39:42,208 --> 00:39:45,078
- OK, go.
- You, down there.

532
00:39:45,169 --> 00:39:49,213
The old man who lived downstairs says
he heard the kid yell "I'm gonna kill ya."

533
00:39:49,299 --> 00:39:51,789
A second later,
he heard the body hit the floor.

534
00:39:51,884 --> 00:39:57,008
He ran to the door and saw the kid run out
of the house. What's that mean to you?

535
00:39:57,097 --> 00:40:00,681
I wonder how clearly he heard
the boy's voice through the ceiling.

536
00:40:00,768 --> 00:40:04,848
He didn't. The window was open. So was
the one upstairs. It was a hot night.

537
00:40:04,941 --> 00:40:08,521
It was another apartment.
It's not easy to identify a shouting voice.

538
00:40:08,610 --> 00:40:10,436
He identified it in court.

539
00:40:10,530 --> 00:40:14,989
The lady across the street looked right in
the open window and saw the stabbing.

540
00:40:15,075 --> 00:40:17,566
- Isn't that enough for you?
- No, it isn't.

541
00:40:17,662 --> 00:40:21,408
Boy, how do you like this guy?
It's like talkin' into a dead phone.

542
00:40:21,499 --> 00:40:24,582
She said she saw it through
the windows of a moving el train.

543
00:40:24,669 --> 00:40:28,202
There were six cars on the train.
She saw it through the last two.

544
00:40:28,297 --> 00:40:32,294
She remembered insignificant details.
How can you argue with that?

545
00:40:32,385 --> 00:40:37,723
Has anybody here any idea
how long it would take an el...

546
00:40:47,234 --> 00:40:49,723
This isn't a game.

547
00:40:52,907 --> 00:40:55,230
Did you see him?

548
00:40:55,324 --> 00:40:58,611
The nerve! The absolute nerve!

549
00:40:58,705 --> 00:41:02,535
- Forget it. It's not important.
- This isn't a game?

550
00:41:02,624 --> 00:41:06,038
- Who does he think he is?
- Forget it now.

551
00:41:06,128 --> 00:41:11,419
Any idea how long it takes an el train
at medium speed to pass a given point?

552
00:41:11,509 --> 00:41:13,381
- What has that to do with it?
- Guess.

553
00:41:13,468 --> 00:41:15,841
- I wouldn't have any idea.
- What do you think?

554
00:41:15,930 --> 00:41:20,637
- I don't know. Ten, twelve seconds?
- A pretty good guess. Anyone else?

555
00:41:20,726 --> 00:41:23,394
- Sounds right to me.
- What's the guessing game for?

556
00:41:23,479 --> 00:41:25,351
- What do you say?
- Ten seconds.

557
00:41:25,439 --> 00:41:28,724
- All right. What are you getting at?
- This.

558
00:41:28,818 --> 00:41:32,483
It takes a six-car el train
ten seconds to pass a given point.

559
00:41:32,572 --> 00:41:37,031
Say the given point is the open window
of the room where the killing took place.

560
00:41:37,118 --> 00:41:40,118
You can reach out
and almost touch the el tracks, right?

561
00:41:40,205 --> 00:41:44,073
Now let me ask you this. Has anyone
here ever lived near the el tracks?

562
00:41:44,168 --> 00:41:48,960
I just finished painting an apartment that
overlooked an el line. It took three days.

563
00:41:49,048 --> 00:41:53,423
- What was it like? Noisy?
- Oh, brother! No matter. We were punchy.

564
00:41:53,509 --> 00:41:56,212
I lived in an apartment
near the el line once.

565
00:41:56,305 --> 00:41:59,424
When the window's open,
the train noise is almost unbearable.

566
00:41:59,516 --> 00:42:03,216
- You can hardly hear yourself think.
- Will you get to the point?

567
00:42:03,313 --> 00:42:08,390
I will. Now, let's take two pieces of
testimony and try to put them together.

568
00:42:08,484 --> 00:42:12,696
First: The old man
in the apartment downstairs.

569
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:15,318
He says he heard the boy say
"I'm gonna kill you",

570
00:42:15,409 --> 00:42:18,076
and a split second later
heard a body hit the floor.

571
00:42:18,162 --> 00:42:19,902
- One second later.
- Right.

572
00:42:19,996 --> 00:42:22,700
Second: The woman across the street

573
00:42:22,791 --> 00:42:26,835
swore positively she looked
out of the window and saw the killing

574
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:30,333
through the last two cars
of a passing el train-the last two cars.

575
00:42:30,423 --> 00:42:33,174
- What are you givin' us here?
- Now, just a minute.

576
00:42:33,260 --> 00:42:38,420
We've agreed that it takes ten seconds
for a train to pass a given point.

577
00:42:38,515 --> 00:42:41,717
Since the woman saw the killing
through the last two cars,

578
00:42:41,810 --> 00:42:47,232
we can assume that the body hit
the floor just as the train went by.

579
00:42:47,317 --> 00:42:51,608
Therefore, the train had been
roaring by the old man's window

580
00:42:51,696 --> 00:42:55,111
a full ten seconds
before the body hit the floor.

581
00:42:55,199 --> 00:43:00,406
The old man - "I'm gonna kill you",
body hitting the floor a second later -

582
00:43:00,496 --> 00:43:04,658
would have had to hear the boy's words
with the el roaring past his nose!

583
00:43:04,750 --> 00:43:07,667
- It's not possible he heard it.
- Of course he heard it.

584
00:43:07,752 --> 00:43:11,085
- Do you think so?
- He said he yelled at the top of his voice.

585
00:43:11,175 --> 00:43:14,425
He couldn't have identified the voice
with the el roaring by.

586
00:43:14,511 --> 00:43:17,345
It was a matter of seconds!
Nobody can be that accurate.

587
00:43:17,430 --> 00:43:22,637
Testimony that could put a boy into the
electric chair shou/d be that accurate.

588
00:43:24,188 --> 00:43:28,599
- I don't think he could have heard it.
- Maybe he didn't, with all that el noise.

589
00:43:28,692 --> 00:43:32,606
- What are you people talkin' about?
- It stands to reason he couldn't have.

590
00:43:32,698 --> 00:43:36,776
- Why lie? What's he got to gain?
- Attention, maybe.

591
00:43:36,867 --> 00:43:42,073
You keep comin' in with bright sayings.
Send 'em to a paper! They pay $3 apiece!

592
00:43:42,165 --> 00:43:44,950
What are you talkin' to him like that for?

593
00:43:45,043 --> 00:43:48,577
A guy who talks like that to an old man
really oughta get stepped on.

594
00:43:48,673 --> 00:43:51,707
You oughta have more respect, mister.

595
00:43:51,799 --> 00:43:56,876
You say stuff like that to him again...
I'm gonna lay you out.

596
00:44:06,315 --> 00:44:09,185
You go ahead. You say anything you like.

597
00:44:10,277 --> 00:44:13,396
Why do you think the old man might lie?

598
00:44:13,489 --> 00:44:17,532
It was just that I looked at him
for a very long time.

599
00:44:17,618 --> 00:44:20,867
The seam of his jacket was split,
under the shoulder.

600
00:44:20,955 --> 00:44:25,331
Did you notice that?
I mean, to come into court like that.

601
00:44:27,838 --> 00:44:31,206
He was a very old man in a torn jacket.

602
00:44:31,716 --> 00:44:35,213
And he walked very slowly to the stand.

603
00:44:35,303 --> 00:44:39,597
He was dragging his left leg
and trying to hide it,

604
00:44:39,682 --> 00:44:42,219
because he was ashamed.

605
00:44:42,309 --> 00:44:46,521
I think I know this man
better than anyone here.

606
00:44:46,608 --> 00:44:49,441
This is a quiet, frightened,

607
00:44:49,526 --> 00:44:51,981
insignificant old man who...

608
00:44:52,071 --> 00:44:54,823
who has been nothing all his life.

609
00:44:54,907 --> 00:44:59,817
Who has never had recognition
or his name in the newspapers.

610
00:44:59,911 --> 00:45:04,121
Nobody knows him. Nobody quotes him.

611
00:45:04,207 --> 00:45:07,955
Nobody seeks his advice after 75 years.

612
00:45:08,921 --> 00:45:13,548
Gentlemen, that's a very sad thing -
to mean nothing.

613
00:45:13,635 --> 00:45:18,461
A man like this needs to be quoted,
to be listened to.

614
00:45:18,597 --> 00:45:22,677
To be quoted just once -
very important to him.

615
00:45:22,768 --> 00:45:25,803
It would be so hard for him
to recede into the background.

616
00:45:25,897 --> 00:45:29,977
Wait a minute. Are you tellin' us he'd lie
just so he could be important once?

617
00:45:30,068 --> 00:45:32,901
No. He wouldn't really lie.

618
00:45:32,987 --> 00:45:36,356
But perhaps he made himself believe
he heard those words

619
00:45:36,449 --> 00:45:38,772
and recognised the boy's face.

620
00:45:38,868 --> 00:45:41,274
That's the most fantastic story ever.

621
00:45:41,371 --> 00:45:45,286
How can you make up a thing like that?
What do you know about it?

622
00:45:54,093 --> 00:45:57,592
- Does anybody want a cough drop?
- I'll take one.

623
00:45:57,680 --> 00:46:01,261
I still don't see how anybody
can think he's not guilty.

624
00:46:01,351 --> 00:46:05,513
There's something else I'd like
to talk about for a minute. Thanks.

625
00:46:05,605 --> 00:46:09,649
We've proved the old man couldn't have
heard the boy say "I'm gonna kill you."

626
00:46:09,734 --> 00:46:13,648
- You didn't prove it at all!
- Wait. Supposing he really did hear it?

627
00:46:13,738 --> 00:46:17,606
This phrase, how many times have
all of us used it? Probably thousands.

628
00:46:17,702 --> 00:46:22,694
"I could kill you for that." "Junior, do that
again and I'll kill you." "Rocky, kill him."

629
00:46:22,789 --> 00:46:27,996
- It doesn't mean we'd really kill anybody.
- The phrase was: "I'm gonna kill you."

630
00:46:28,087 --> 00:46:30,375
The kid yelled it at the top of his lungs.

631
00:46:30,464 --> 00:46:34,081
Don't tell me he didn't mean it.
Anybody says it like that, they mean it!

632
00:46:34,175 --> 00:46:36,083
Gee, I don't know.

633
00:46:36,179 --> 00:46:39,926
I was arguing with the guy I work next to
at the bank a few weeks ago.

634
00:46:40,014 --> 00:46:42,470
He called me an idiot, so I yelled at him.

635
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:45,346
This guy is trying to make you
believe what isn't so!

636
00:46:45,437 --> 00:46:47,512
The kid said he'd kill him and he did!

637
00:46:47,606 --> 00:46:52,267
Do you really think the boy'd shout it out
so the whole neighbourhood could hear?

638
00:46:52,360 --> 00:46:57,272
- He's much too bright for that.
- Bright? He's a common, ignorant slob.

639
00:46:57,367 --> 00:46:59,442
He don't even speak good English.

640
00:46:59,536 --> 00:47:02,986
He doesn't even speak good English.

641
00:47:04,499 --> 00:47:08,366
Mr Foreman, I'd like to
change my vote to not guilty.

642
00:47:09,004 --> 00:47:11,125
- You what?
- You heard me.

643
00:47:11,214 --> 00:47:14,665
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, I'm sure.

644
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:17,428
The vote is nine to three
in favour of guilty.

645
00:47:17,513 --> 00:47:20,003
Well, if this isn't the livin' end!

646
00:47:24,144 --> 00:47:27,727
What are you basin' it on?
Stories this guy made up?

647
00:47:27,814 --> 00:47:31,895
You oughta write for one of those kooky
detective magazines, make a fortune.

648
00:47:31,987 --> 00:47:35,651
For cryin' out loud, the kid's own lawyer
knew he didn't stand a chance.

649
00:47:35,739 --> 00:47:39,273
Right from the beginning, his own
lawyer knew, and you could see it.

650
00:47:39,368 --> 00:47:43,580
Boy, oh boy, I'm telling ya.
This guy here is really somethin'.

651
00:47:43,664 --> 00:47:47,032
The kid had a lawyer, didn't he?
He presented his case, not you.

652
00:47:47,125 --> 00:47:49,996
- How come you say so much?
- Lawyers aren't infallible.

653
00:47:50,087 --> 00:47:53,122
- Baltimore, please.
- He was court-appointed.

654
00:47:53,216 --> 00:47:55,420
- What's that supposed to mean?
- A lot.

655
00:47:55,510 --> 00:47:58,760
He didn't want the case
or he resented being appointed.

656
00:47:58,847 --> 00:48:03,306
It's the kind of case that brings no money,
no glory, not much chance of winning.

657
00:48:03,392 --> 00:48:06,511
That's not a very promising
situation for a young lawyer.

658
00:48:06,604 --> 00:48:11,516
He'd really have to believe in his client to
put up a good case. Obviously he didn't.

659
00:48:11,611 --> 00:48:13,686
Of course he didn't.

660
00:48:14,574 --> 00:48:16,897
Who the heck could?

661
00:48:16,991 --> 00:48:19,943
Except maybe some guy's mother
or somebody.

662
00:48:20,036 --> 00:48:22,953
Oh, look.
Will you look at the time? Come on.

663
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:26,572
Pardon me. I have made some notes here,

664
00:48:26,666 --> 00:48:30,081
and I would like, please,
to say something.

665
00:48:30,172 --> 00:48:32,958
I have been listening very carefully and...

666
00:48:33,049 --> 00:48:36,916
it seems to me that this man
has some very good points to make.

667
00:48:37,013 --> 00:48:41,674
From what was presented at the trial,
the boy looks guilty, on the surface.

668
00:48:41,767 --> 00:48:45,598
- But maybe if we go deeper...
- Come on, will ya?

669
00:48:45,687 --> 00:48:47,927
There is a question I would like to ask.

670
00:48:48,023 --> 00:48:51,474
Let us assume that the boy
really did commit the murder.

671
00:48:51,568 --> 00:48:54,935
Now, this happened
at 10 minutes after 12.

672
00:48:55,029 --> 00:48:57,566
Now, how was he caught by the police?

673
00:48:57,658 --> 00:49:01,785
He came back home...
at three o'clock or so,

674
00:49:01,869 --> 00:49:05,654
and he was captured by two detectives
in the hallway of his house.

675
00:49:05,750 --> 00:49:10,375
Now, my question is:
If he really had killed his father,

676
00:49:10,463 --> 00:49:13,915
why would he come back home
three hours later?

677
00:49:14,009 --> 00:49:16,877
Wouldn't he be afraid of being caught?

678
00:49:16,969 --> 00:49:21,049
He came home for his knife. It's not nice
to leave knives in people's chests.

679
00:49:21,141 --> 00:49:23,974
Yeah, especially relatives'.

680
00:49:24,060 --> 00:49:26,680
I don't see anything funny about it.

681
00:49:26,772 --> 00:49:29,974
The boy knew the knife
could be identified.

682
00:49:30,067 --> 00:49:34,561
- He had to get it before the police did.
- If he knew the knife could be identified,

683
00:49:34,653 --> 00:49:37,274
why did he leave it there in the first place?

684
00:49:37,365 --> 00:49:42,822
I think we can assume the boy ran out in a
state of panic, having just killed his father.

685
00:49:42,912 --> 00:49:45,913
He calmed down and realised
he'd left his knife there.

686
00:49:45,999 --> 00:49:48,915
This, then, depends
on your definition of panic.

687
00:49:49,002 --> 00:49:53,961
He would have had to be calm enough to
wipe off any fingerprints left on the knife.

688
00:49:54,051 --> 00:49:57,917
Now, where did this panic start
and where did it end?

689
00:49:58,012 --> 00:50:00,798
You voted guilty. What side are you on?

690
00:50:00,890 --> 00:50:04,056
I don't believe I have to be loyal
to one side or the other.

691
00:50:04,143 --> 00:50:09,386
- I'm simply asking questions.
- This is just off the top of my head but...

692
00:50:09,482 --> 00:50:13,694
If /'d done the stabbing, I'd take a chance
and go back for the knife.

693
00:50:13,779 --> 00:50:16,349
I'll bet he figured
nobody'd seen him running out

694
00:50:16,447 --> 00:50:19,234
and the body wouldn't be discovered
till the next day.

695
00:50:19,326 --> 00:50:23,536
After all, it was the middle of the night.
He figured it'd be found the next day.

696
00:50:23,622 --> 00:50:25,660
Pardon. This is my whole point.

697
00:50:25,748 --> 00:50:29,747
The woman across the street testified
that the moment after she saw the killing,

698
00:50:29,838 --> 00:50:32,078
that is, a moment after the train went by,

699
00:50:32,172 --> 00:50:35,337
she screamed, and then went
to telephone the police.

700
00:50:35,426 --> 00:50:38,960
Now, the boy certainly
must have heard the scream.

701
00:50:39,054 --> 00:50:42,304
So he knew that
somebody saw something.

702
00:50:42,392 --> 00:50:45,262
I just don't think
that he would have gone back.

703
00:50:45,354 --> 00:50:49,978
Two things. One: He may not have heard
the scream. Perhaps it wasn't very loud.

704
00:50:50,066 --> 00:50:53,400
Two: If he did, he may not
have connected it with his own acts.

705
00:50:53,486 --> 00:50:56,522
He lived in a neighbourhood
where screams were commonplace.

706
00:50:56,615 --> 00:51:00,991
- There's your answer.
- Maybe. Maybe the boy did kill his father.

707
00:51:01,078 --> 00:51:03,484
Didn't hear the scream,
did run out in a panic,

708
00:51:03,580 --> 00:51:08,454
calmed down later and came back for the
knife, risking being caught by the police.

709
00:51:08,543 --> 00:51:11,496
Maybe those things happened,
but maybe they didn't.

710
00:51:11,588 --> 00:51:15,834
There's enough doubt to wonder if he was
there at all at the time of the killing.

711
00:51:15,924 --> 00:51:19,376
What do you mean? Didn't the old man
see him running out of the house?

712
00:51:19,472 --> 00:51:21,297
He's twisting the facts.

713
00:51:21,390 --> 00:51:24,972
Did or didn't the old man see the kid
running out of the house at 12.10?

714
00:51:25,062 --> 00:51:27,731
- Well, did or didn't he?
- He says he did.

715
00:51:27,814 --> 00:51:30,266
Says he did? Boy, how do you like that?

716
00:51:30,357 --> 00:51:33,476
- Witnesses can make mistakes.
- Sure, when you want them to!

717
00:51:33,568 --> 00:51:36,273
- Or when he wants them to!
- Keep the yelling down.

718
00:51:36,365 --> 00:51:41,192
Maybe we need a little yelling. These
guys keep going off every which way.

719
00:51:41,285 --> 00:51:44,571
Did hear the scream, didn't hear it -
what difference does it make?

720
00:51:44,665 --> 00:51:48,529
You're talking about little details
and forgetting the important stuff.

721
00:51:48,624 --> 00:51:51,293
- I call for another vote.
- I'm talking here!

722
00:51:51,379 --> 00:51:53,455
Another vote called for.

723
00:51:53,549 --> 00:51:56,039
Now let's take our seats.

724
00:51:59,139 --> 00:52:01,592
I never saw so much time
spent on nothin'.

725
00:52:01,682 --> 00:52:03,968
It only takes a second.

726
00:52:04,644 --> 00:52:08,059
OK, I guess the fastest way is
to find out who's voting not guilty.

727
00:52:08,147 --> 00:52:11,931
All those voting not guilty,
please raise your hands.

728
00:52:12,025 --> 00:52:15,641
Still the same. One, two, three
not guilty. Nine guilty.

729
00:52:15,737 --> 00:52:20,696
So now where are we? We can yakety-yak
till next Tuesday. Where's it getting us?

730
00:52:20,785 --> 00:52:23,820
Pardon. I vote not guilty.

731
00:52:25,874 --> 00:52:30,250
What are you talkin' about? I mean,
we're all goin' crazy in here or somethin'.

732
00:52:30,336 --> 00:52:33,750
The kid is guilty.
Why don't you listen to the facts?

733
00:52:33,840 --> 00:52:36,413
Tell them, will ya?
This is gettin' to be a joke.

734
00:52:36,510 --> 00:52:39,876
The vote is eight to four in favour of guilty.

735
00:52:39,970 --> 00:52:43,719
What is this?
Love Your Underprivileged Brother Week?

736
00:52:43,809 --> 00:52:47,473
I want you to tell me why
you changed your vote. Give me reasons.

737
00:52:47,562 --> 00:52:52,140
I don't have to defend my decision to you.
There is a reasonable doubt in my mind.

738
00:52:52,234 --> 00:52:55,187
Reasonable doubt?
Nothing but words. Look at this.

739
00:52:55,280 --> 00:53:00,274
The kid you just decided isn't guilty
was seen ramming this into his father!

740
00:53:00,367 --> 00:53:05,242
- What about this, Mr Reasonable Doubt?
- That's not the knife, remember?

741
00:53:05,329 --> 00:53:09,908
- Oh, brilliant!
- I'm tellin' you, this is the craziest.

742
00:53:10,004 --> 00:53:14,961
I mean, what are we supposed to believe?
You're pullin' stories out of thin air.

743
00:53:15,049 --> 00:53:18,881
A guy like this, if he's sittin' ringside
at the Dempsey-Firpo fight,

744
00:53:18,970 --> 00:53:20,794
he'd be trying to tell you that...

745
00:53:21,347 --> 00:53:23,635
Look. Now what about the old man?

746
00:53:23,726 --> 00:53:27,426
Are we supposed to believe he didn't
see the kid tearin' down the steps

747
00:53:27,521 --> 00:53:29,475
15 seconds after the killing?

748
00:53:29,606 --> 00:53:32,227
He's just sayin' so to be important, right?

749
00:53:32,318 --> 00:53:34,440
- What's the point of it all?
- Hold it.

750
00:53:34,528 --> 00:53:36,815
The Baltimore rooter is heard from again.

751
00:53:36,904 --> 00:53:40,440
- And pop-ups are fallin' for base hits.
- Hold on a second. Look.

752
00:53:40,535 --> 00:53:44,067
- Did the old man say he ran to the door?
- What's the difference?

753
00:53:44,163 --> 00:53:48,242
- He got there, didn't he?
- He said he ran. At least I think he did.

754
00:53:48,333 --> 00:53:51,536
I don't remember, but I don't see
how he could have run.

755
00:53:51,630 --> 00:53:55,211
He said he went from his bedroom
to the front door. Isn't that enough?

756
00:53:55,299 --> 00:53:57,754
- Where was the bedroom?
- Down the hall.

757
00:53:57,844 --> 00:54:00,593
- Don't you remember that?
- No.

758
00:54:00,679 --> 00:54:05,756
- I want to see a diagram of the apartment.
- Why don't we have him on trial again?

759
00:54:05,853 --> 00:54:08,139
You're the only one
wants to see exhibits.

760
00:54:08,229 --> 00:54:11,562
- I want to see this one, too.
- I'd like to stop wastin' time.

761
00:54:11,650 --> 00:54:14,899
If we're gonna wade through
that nonsense about the body...

762
00:54:14,985 --> 00:54:20,441
No, but I'd like to know if an old man
who drags one foot cos he had a stroke

763
00:54:20,533 --> 00:54:23,320
can get from his bedroom
to his front door in 15 seconds.

764
00:54:23,411 --> 00:54:25,153
- He said 20.
- He said 15.

765
00:54:25,247 --> 00:54:28,911
- 20. What are you tryin' to distort?
- He said 15.

766
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:32,166
How does he know how long
15 seconds is? You can't judge that.

767
00:54:32,254 --> 00:54:34,790
He said 15. He was positive about it.

768
00:54:34,882 --> 00:54:37,123
He was an old man! He was confused!

769
00:54:37,216 --> 00:54:40,834
How could he be positive about anything?

770
00:54:47,438 --> 00:54:51,565
I don't see what you're going to prove.
The man said he saw the boy running out.

771
00:54:51,649 --> 00:54:54,933
Let's see if the details bear him out.
As the body hit the floor,

772
00:54:55,028 --> 00:54:58,443
he said he heard footsteps upstairs,
running to the front door.

773
00:54:58,531 --> 00:55:01,732
Heard the upstairs door open,
the footsteps start down.

774
00:55:01,826 --> 00:55:07,579
He said he got to his own door in, at most,
15 seconds. If the killer ran immediately...

775
00:55:07,666 --> 00:55:10,239
- Maybe he didn't.
- The old man said he did.

776
00:55:10,336 --> 00:55:13,668
You oughta be at
that hair-splitters' convention.

777
00:55:13,754 --> 00:55:16,078
Why don't you stop
making smart remarks?

778
00:55:16,174 --> 00:55:20,753
My friend, for your three dollars a day,
you have to listen to everything.

779
00:55:20,847 --> 00:55:26,766
Here's the apartment. The old man's was
directly beneath and exactly the same.

780
00:55:26,853 --> 00:55:32,095
Here are the el tracks, the bedroom, living
room, kitchen, bathroom, hall, stairs.

781
00:55:32,191 --> 00:55:34,431
The old man was in this bedroom here.

782
00:55:34,526 --> 00:55:37,895
He says he crossed to the door,
walked down the hall, opened the door

783
00:55:37,989 --> 00:55:41,275
just in time to see the boy
running down the stairs. Am I right?

784
00:55:41,368 --> 00:55:43,690
That's the story, for the 19th time.

785
00:55:43,787 --> 00:55:47,285
- 15 seconds after the body hit the floor.
- Correct.

786
00:55:47,373 --> 00:55:49,449
Now, let's see. It was...

787
00:55:49,543 --> 00:55:53,325
It's 12 feet from the bed to the door.
The hall is 43 feet.

788
00:55:53,420 --> 00:55:56,872
He would have had to walk 12 feet,
open the bedroom door,

789
00:55:56,967 --> 00:56:00,547
walk 43 feet down and open
the front door, all in 15 seconds.

790
00:56:00,637 --> 00:56:02,713
- Could he have done it?
- Sure.

791
00:56:02,806 --> 00:56:05,806
He walks slowly. He needed help
into the witness chair.

792
00:56:05,893 --> 00:56:11,233
- You make it sound like a long walk.
- For an old man who had a stroke, it is.

793
00:56:11,316 --> 00:56:13,887
- What are you doin'?
- I'm gonna try it.

794
00:56:13,984 --> 00:56:16,984
What do you mean?
Why didn't his lawyer bring it up?

795
00:56:17,071 --> 00:56:21,200
- Maybe he just didn't think of it.
- Do you think he's an idiot? It's obvious.

796
00:56:21,284 --> 00:56:24,318
- Did you think of it?
- It don't matter. He didn't bring it up

797
00:56:24,411 --> 00:56:26,404
because he knew it'd hurt his case.

798
00:56:26,498 --> 00:56:30,541
Or because it would have meant bullying
and badgering a helpless old man.

799
00:56:30,625 --> 00:56:33,958
That doesn't sit well with a jury.
Most lawyers avoid it.

800
00:56:34,047 --> 00:56:36,716
- What kind of a bum is he?
- That's what I'm asking.

801
00:56:36,800 --> 00:56:39,835
Pass me that chair.
Those two chairs are the old man's bed.

802
00:56:39,929 --> 00:56:42,714
I just paced off 12 feet.
This is the bedroom door.

803
00:56:42,805 --> 00:56:45,675
That's crazy.
You can't re-create a thing like that.

804
00:56:45,768 --> 00:56:51,224
The hall was 43 feet.
I'll pace from that wall and back again.

805
00:56:51,314 --> 00:56:54,849
This is insane. What are you
wasting everybody's time for?

806
00:56:54,946 --> 00:56:58,229
According to you, it'll only take
15 seconds. We can spare that.

807
00:57:01,617 --> 00:57:03,693
Come on. Knock it off.

808
00:57:03,786 --> 00:57:06,702
OK. OK, OK, killer.

809
00:57:07,498 --> 00:57:09,574
Yeah.

810
00:57:11,377 --> 00:57:15,704
Will you stand there and mark the front
door? It was chain-locked, remember.

811
00:57:15,798 --> 00:57:18,171
- Who's got a watch with a second hand?
- I have.

812
00:57:18,260 --> 00:57:22,671
Stamp your foot. That'll be the body
falling. You can time me from there.

813
00:57:22,764 --> 00:57:26,809
- What are we gonna do, play charades?
- What are we waiting for?

814
00:57:26,893 --> 00:57:29,299
I wanna wait till
the second hand reaches 60.

815
00:57:29,396 --> 00:57:31,470
Aw, come on!

816
00:57:37,739 --> 00:57:42,066
Come on, speed it up.
He can walk twice as fast as that.

817
00:57:42,159 --> 00:57:45,907
If you want me to walk
faster than that, I will.

818
00:58:01,553 --> 00:58:04,756
- Lock. Door. Stop.
- Right.

819
00:58:04,850 --> 00:58:06,840
What's the time?

820
00:58:06,933 --> 00:58:10,136
Exactly... 41 seconds.

821
00:58:10,231 --> 00:58:14,726
This is what I think happened. The old
man heard the fight a few hours earlier.

822
00:58:14,818 --> 00:58:17,487
When he's in bed,
he heard the body hit the floor,

823
00:58:17,571 --> 00:58:21,104
heard the woman scream, got to
his front door as fast as he could,

824
00:58:21,199 --> 00:58:23,772
heard somebody running
and assumed it was the boy.

825
00:58:23,868 --> 00:58:26,986
- I think that's possible.
- Assumed?

826
00:58:28,456 --> 00:58:31,409
Brother, I've seen all kinds
of dishonesty in my day,

827
00:58:31,502 --> 00:58:34,455
but this little display takes the cake.

828
00:58:34,548 --> 00:58:39,458
You all come in here with your hearts
bleedin' about slum kids and injustice.

829
00:58:39,552 --> 00:58:43,844
You listen to some fairy tales. You start
getting through to these old ladies.

830
00:58:43,930 --> 00:58:46,800
You're not getting through to me.
I've had enough.

831
00:58:46,892 --> 00:58:51,105
What's the matter with you guys?
You all know he's guilty! He's got to burn!

832
00:58:51,189 --> 00:58:54,605
- He'll slip through our fingers.
- Slip through our fingers?

833
00:58:54,694 --> 00:58:58,606
- Are you his executioner?
- I'm one of 'em.

834
00:58:58,697 --> 00:59:02,645
- Perhaps you'd like to pull the switch.
- For this kid, you bet I would.

835
00:59:02,742 --> 00:59:06,609
I feel sorry for you. What it must
feel like to wanna pull the switch!

836
00:59:06,706 --> 00:59:10,703
Ever since you walked in, you've acted
like a self-appointed public avenger.

837
00:59:10,793 --> 00:59:14,837
You want to see this boy die because
you want it, not because of the facts.

838
00:59:14,923 --> 00:59:17,459
- You're a sadist.
- You...

839
00:59:17,550 --> 00:59:21,296
Let me go! I'll kill him! I'll kill him!

840
00:59:21,386 --> 00:59:24,672
You don't really mean
you'll kill me, do you?

841
00:59:31,105 --> 00:59:34,888
- Anything wrong? I heard some noise.
- No, everything's all right.

842
00:59:34,984 --> 00:59:37,736
We're just... Friendly little argument.

843
00:59:37,821 --> 00:59:43,028
We're through with that diagram.
You can take it if you want. Here you are.

844
00:59:49,624 --> 00:59:52,114
What are you lookin' at?

845
01:00:12,397 --> 01:00:15,267
- Somebody has to start off again.
- I beg pardon...

846
01:00:15,358 --> 01:00:18,274
"I beg pardon."
What are you so polite about?

847
01:00:18,362 --> 01:00:23,522
For the same reason you're not.
It's the way I was brought up.

848
01:00:24,537 --> 01:00:28,485
This fighting... That's not
why we are here, to fight.

849
01:00:28,581 --> 01:00:31,071
We have a responsibility.

850
01:00:32,209 --> 01:00:36,622
This, I have always thought,
is a remarkable thing about democracy.

851
01:00:36,714 --> 01:00:39,003
That we are...

852
01:00:40,428 --> 01:00:42,502
What is the word?

853
01:00:42,596 --> 01:00:46,925
Notified. That we are notified by mail
to come down to this place

854
01:00:47,018 --> 01:00:54,312
to decide on the guilt or innocence of a
man we... we have never heard of before.

855
01:00:54,400 --> 01:00:59,606
We have nothing to gain or lose
by... by our verdict.

856
01:00:59,697 --> 01:01:03,908
This is one of the reasons
why we are strong.

857
01:01:03,994 --> 01:01:07,942
We should not make it a... personal thing.

858
01:01:11,501 --> 01:01:15,117
If nobody else has an idea,
I might have a cutie here.

859
01:01:15,212 --> 01:01:17,749
Let's throw it out
and see if the cat licks it up.

860
01:01:17,840 --> 01:01:20,295
- The cat licks it up?
- Yeah. The boy...

861
01:01:24,930 --> 01:01:30,352
Look how dark it's gettin' out there.
I bet we're gonna have a storm now.

862
01:01:31,397 --> 01:01:34,680
Boy, oh boy. It's really hot, huh?

863
01:01:35,401 --> 01:01:40,642
- Pardon me, but... don't you ever sweat?
- No, I don't.

864
01:01:41,990 --> 01:01:45,277
Listen. I... I was wonderin' if...

865
01:01:46,704 --> 01:01:49,573
Maybe... maybe we should
take another vote.

866
01:01:49,666 --> 01:01:54,955
Great. Maybe we can follow this one up
with a little dancing and refreshments!

867
01:01:55,046 --> 01:01:58,165
- Mr Foreman?
- Well, that's OK with me.

868
01:01:58,258 --> 01:02:02,006
Anyone doesn't wanna vote?
Hey, come on.

869
01:02:02,888 --> 01:02:05,840
- Sorry.
- I think we ought to have an open ballot.

870
01:02:05,932 --> 01:02:09,216
Call out our votes, you know?
Let's see who stands where.

871
01:02:09,310 --> 01:02:12,844
Well, that sounds fair to me.
Anyone object?

872
01:02:14,649 --> 01:02:18,183
OK. I'll call off your jury numbers. One?

873
01:02:18,278 --> 01:02:21,528
Oh, that's me. I vote guilty. Two?

874
01:02:23,033 --> 01:02:24,940
Not guilty.

875
01:02:25,034 --> 01:02:26,777
Number three?

876
01:02:26,870 --> 01:02:28,777
Guilty.

877
01:02:28,872 --> 01:02:30,948
Number four?

878
01:02:32,169 --> 01:02:33,827
Guilty.

879
01:02:33,920 --> 01:02:35,461
Number five?

880
01:02:35,547 --> 01:02:37,620
Not guilty.

881
01:02:37,715 --> 01:02:39,837
Number six?

882
01:02:39,926 --> 01:02:41,881
Not guilty.

883
01:02:41,968 --> 01:02:43,676
Number seven?

884
01:02:43,763 --> 01:02:45,553
Guilty.

885
01:02:45,641 --> 01:02:47,513
Number eight?

886
01:02:47,600 --> 01:02:49,675
Not guilty.

887
01:02:50,813 --> 01:02:53,767
- Number nine?
- Not guilty.

888
01:02:53,859 --> 01:02:56,810
- Number ten?
- Guilty.

889
01:02:57,692 --> 01:02:59,685
Number eleven?

890
01:02:59,780 --> 01:03:01,605
Not guilty.

891
01:03:01,698 --> 01:03:03,773
Number twelve?

892
01:03:04,159 --> 01:03:06,399
Number twelve!

893
01:03:06,495 --> 01:03:08,783
Guilty.

894
01:03:14,087 --> 01:03:16,755
The vote is now six to six.

895
01:03:16,839 --> 01:03:19,756
And we go into extra innings here, eh?

896
01:03:21,177 --> 01:03:26,419
Six to six! I'm telling you, some of you
people in here must be out of your minds.

897
01:03:26,515 --> 01:03:28,091
A kid like that!

898
01:03:28,185 --> 01:03:31,634
I don't think the kind of boy he is
has anything to do with it.

899
01:03:31,728 --> 01:03:34,479
- Facts determine the case.
- Don't give me that!

900
01:03:34,566 --> 01:03:37,769
I'm sick and tired of facts.
You can twist 'em any way you like.

901
01:03:37,861 --> 01:03:41,144
That's exactly the point
this gentleman has been making.

902
01:03:41,239 --> 01:03:44,025
You keep shouting
at the top of your lungs...

903
01:03:45,327 --> 01:03:49,453
I'd like to be a few years younger.
That man gets on my...

904
01:03:52,835 --> 01:03:55,324
- My, it's hot in here.
- Want a drink of water?

905
01:03:55,420 --> 01:03:57,494
No, no. Thanks. Thanks.

906
01:04:07,100 --> 01:04:11,594
- It's gonna rain.
- Well, how'd you figure that out, killer?

907
01:04:12,604 --> 01:04:17,147
- How come you changed your vote?
- It just seemed there was room for doubt.

908
01:04:17,234 --> 01:04:20,269
- You haven't got a leg to stand on.
- I don't feel that way.

909
01:04:20,363 --> 01:04:23,564
- A lot of details never came out.
- Yeah, well, good luck.

910
01:04:23,658 --> 01:04:29,411
Come on. You're like everybody else.
You think too much, you get mixed up.

911
01:04:29,497 --> 01:04:33,496
- You know what I mean?
- I don't think you have any right to...

912
01:04:33,585 --> 01:04:35,659
Loudmouth.

913
01:05:28,935 --> 01:05:31,971
Look at that come down, will ya?

914
01:05:32,563 --> 01:05:37,189
You know, this reminds me
of a storm we had last...

915
01:05:38,567 --> 01:05:42,185
Was it November?
I don't know. Something.

916
01:05:42,281 --> 01:05:46,148
It was quite a storm we had.
It was right in the middle of a game.

917
01:05:46,243 --> 01:05:51,284
We were behind-seven to six. We'd just
started to move the ball, made a tackle.

918
01:05:51,373 --> 01:05:56,166
It was gonna cut right in, slash through,
slashed right in, cut right through...

919
01:05:56,255 --> 01:05:58,329
And...

920
01:05:58,841 --> 01:06:01,329
We had this kid - Slattery.

921
01:06:02,385 --> 01:06:04,877
He was an ox. A real ox.

922
01:06:05,723 --> 01:06:08,127
I wish I had another one just like him.

923
01:06:08,224 --> 01:06:12,685
I forgot to tell you. I'm the assistant head
coach at Andrew J McCorkle High School.

924
01:06:12,772 --> 01:06:15,011
That's out in Queens.

925
01:06:15,106 --> 01:06:19,767
And anyway... we're starting
to move along real nice.

926
01:06:19,860 --> 01:06:24,570
You know, their whole line is just...
just comin' apart.

927
01:06:24,659 --> 01:06:28,275
And it starts to come down,
cats and dogs, just like this.

928
01:06:28,369 --> 01:06:32,154
Just... whoosh! You know, right down.

929
01:06:32,250 --> 01:06:35,701
Well, it was murder, you know?

930
01:06:35,796 --> 01:06:41,002
I swear, I... I nearly bawled.
Just... We couldn't go nowhere.

931
01:06:59,069 --> 01:07:02,652
Hey, what is it with this fan here?
How come...

932
01:07:12,500 --> 01:07:15,417
Must have been
on the same switch with the lights.

933
01:07:15,504 --> 01:07:18,503
Well, things are lookin' up here, huh?

934
01:07:19,214 --> 01:07:21,291
Yeah.

935
01:07:25,513 --> 01:07:27,587
Boy, that's better.

936
01:07:34,273 --> 01:07:36,762
Hey! Two points.

937
01:07:41,614 --> 01:07:44,447
You guys ever go to the Garden?

938
01:07:45,867 --> 01:07:48,737
That's a damn stupid thing to do.

939
01:07:48,829 --> 01:07:50,903
Oh, I'm sorry. I...

940
01:07:52,040 --> 01:07:54,115
You know?

941
01:07:55,211 --> 01:07:57,582
Pardon me.

942
01:07:57,671 --> 01:08:02,499
Well, how do you like it? Even-steven.
Pretty surprising, isn't it?

943
01:08:02,594 --> 01:08:04,668
Yes.

944
01:08:05,888 --> 01:08:10,929
That... business before, when that tall guy,
whatshisname, was tryin' to bait me?

945
01:08:11,019 --> 01:08:14,850
That doesn't prove anything.
I'm a... pretty excitable person.

946
01:08:14,939 --> 01:08:18,723
Where does he come off
calling me a public avenger, a sadist?

947
01:08:18,818 --> 01:08:22,481
Anyone in his right mind
would blow his stack.

948
01:08:22,572 --> 01:08:24,812
He was just tryin' to bait me.

949
01:08:24,905 --> 01:08:27,396
He did an excellent job.

950
01:08:29,455 --> 01:08:31,576
I think we're going nowhere here.

951
01:08:31,665 --> 01:08:34,238
I'm ready to walk into court
and declare a hung jury.

952
01:08:34,335 --> 01:08:37,583
- There's no point in this thing going on.
- I go for that, too.

953
01:08:37,671 --> 01:08:40,374
Let the kid take his chance
with 12 other guys.

954
01:08:40,464 --> 01:08:43,715
The judge won't accept a hung jury.
We haven't been here long.

955
01:08:43,803 --> 01:08:46,838
- Well, let's find out.
- I am not in favour of that.

956
01:08:46,931 --> 01:08:50,464
This kid wouldn't stand a chance
with another jury, and you know it.

957
01:08:50,559 --> 01:08:53,476
Come on, we're hung.
Nobody's gonna change his vote.

958
01:08:53,561 --> 01:08:56,930
- Still no room for reasonable doubt?
- No.

959
01:08:57,025 --> 01:09:02,232
Pardon. Maybe you don't fully understand
the term "reasonable doubt".

960
01:09:02,322 --> 01:09:05,441
What do you mean, I don't understand?

961
01:09:05,534 --> 01:09:08,866
How do you like this guy?
I'm tellin' you, they're all alike.

962
01:09:08,953 --> 01:09:11,703
They come over here
and before they can take a breath,

963
01:09:11,790 --> 01:09:14,493
they're telling us how to run the show.

964
01:09:14,583 --> 01:09:17,667
- Boy, the arrogance of this guy!
- All right.

965
01:09:17,755 --> 01:09:20,956
Let's stop the arguing
for about two minutes in here.

966
01:09:21,049 --> 01:09:23,586
Now, who's got
something constructive to say?

967
01:09:23,678 --> 01:09:27,092
I'd like to go over something,
if you gentlemen don't mind.

968
01:09:27,181 --> 01:09:29,636
An important point
for the prosecution was

969
01:09:29,726 --> 01:09:34,802
the fact that after the boy claimed he was
at the movies when the killing took place,

970
01:09:34,899 --> 01:09:38,976
he couldn't remember the names
of the movies or who starred in them.

971
01:09:39,066 --> 01:09:43,017
- This gentleman has made that point.
- That's correct.

972
01:09:43,114 --> 01:09:47,573
It's the only alibi the boy offered, and
he couldn't back it up with any details.

973
01:09:47,660 --> 01:09:50,780
In the boy's place,
do you think you could remember details

974
01:09:50,872 --> 01:09:54,370
after an upsetting experience
such as being slapped by your father?

975
01:09:54,458 --> 01:09:57,743
I think so, if there were
any special details to remember.

976
01:09:57,837 --> 01:10:01,170
The boy couldn't remember the movies
because he wasn't there.

977
01:10:01,258 --> 01:10:06,216
According to the police testimony,
the boy was questioned in the kitchen,

978
01:10:06,304 --> 01:10:09,221
while the body of his father
was lying in the bedroom.

979
01:10:09,309 --> 01:10:11,762
Do you think
you could remember details?

980
01:10:11,851 --> 01:10:13,973
- I do.
- Under great emotional stress?

981
01:10:14,062 --> 01:10:18,226
- Under great emotional stress.
- He remembered them correctly in court.

982
01:10:18,316 --> 01:10:21,980
Yes. His lawyer took great pains
to bring that out.

983
01:10:22,070 --> 01:10:26,116
He had three months to the day of the trial
in which to memorise them.

984
01:10:26,201 --> 01:10:30,743
It's not difficult for a lawyer to find out
what played on a particular night.

985
01:10:30,830 --> 01:10:34,448
I'll take the testimony
from right after the murder,

986
01:10:34,542 --> 01:10:38,869
when he couldn't remember a thing about
the movies, great emotional stress or not.

987
01:10:39,213 --> 01:10:42,498
- I'd like to ask you a personal question.
- Go ahead.

988
01:10:42,593 --> 01:10:45,795
- Where were you last night?
- I was home all night.

989
01:10:45,886 --> 01:10:48,376
- How about the night before that?
- What is this?

990
01:10:48,473 --> 01:10:52,340
It's all right. I left the office at 8.30
and went straight home and to bed.

991
01:10:52,434 --> 01:10:56,727
- And the night before that?
- That was... Tuesday night.

992
01:10:56,814 --> 01:10:59,768
- The bridge tournament. I played bridge.
- Monday night?

993
01:10:59,860 --> 01:11:03,311
When you get to
New Year's Eve 1954, let me know.

994
01:11:05,157 --> 01:11:11,526
Monday night? Monday night...
my wife and I went to the movies.

995
01:11:11,622 --> 01:11:14,577
- What did you see?
- The Scar/et Circ/e. A whodunit.

996
01:11:14,667 --> 01:11:17,537
- What was the second feature?
- The...

997
01:11:19,381 --> 01:11:22,084
I'll tell you in a minute. The...

998
01:11:22,175 --> 01:11:24,249
Remarkab/e Mrs...

999
01:11:25,636 --> 01:11:27,711
Something.

1000
01:11:28,932 --> 01:11:31,504
Mrs Bainbridge.
The Remarkab/e Mrs Bainbridge.

1001
01:11:31,602 --> 01:11:35,347
I saw that. It's called
The Amazing Mrs Bainbridge.

1002
01:11:35,437 --> 01:11:38,009
Yes. The Amazing Mrs Bainbridge.

1003
01:11:38,107 --> 01:11:40,646
Who was in
The Amazing Mrs Bainbridge?

1004
01:11:40,736 --> 01:11:44,567
Barbara... Long, I think it was.

1005
01:11:44,657 --> 01:11:47,026
A dark, very pretty girl.

1006
01:11:47,952 --> 01:11:51,319
- Ling or... Long. Something like that.
- Who else?

1007
01:11:51,413 --> 01:11:53,570
I'd never heard of them before.

1008
01:11:53,666 --> 01:11:58,292
It was a very inexpensive
second feature, with unknown...

1009
01:11:58,378 --> 01:12:02,541
And you weren't under
an emotional stress, were you?

1010
01:12:04,259 --> 01:12:06,334
No.

1011
01:12:06,429 --> 01:12:08,503
I wasn't.

1012
01:12:10,056 --> 01:12:13,057
- I think the point is made.
- Big point.

1013
01:12:14,730 --> 01:12:18,643
You can talk till your tongue is
draggin' on the floor. The boy is guilty.

1014
01:12:18,734 --> 01:12:20,973
Know what I mean, my friend?

1015
01:12:21,068 --> 01:12:25,231
- You got those cough drops?
- They're all gone, my friend.

1016
01:12:26,532 --> 01:12:30,577
Oh, boy. Look at that rain.
There goes your ball game.

1017
01:12:31,204 --> 01:12:33,528
It's only a shower.

1018
01:12:33,624 --> 01:12:36,327
Besides, they got the infield covered.

1019
01:12:36,417 --> 01:12:39,917
Say, could I see that knife
a second, please?

1020
01:12:41,716 --> 01:12:46,342
Well, we're still tied up six to six.
Who's got a suggestion?

1021
01:12:46,428 --> 01:12:50,590
- It's 5 after 6. Let's get some dinner.
- Why don't we wait till 7 o'clock?

1022
01:12:50,683 --> 01:12:51,548
OK with me.

1023
01:12:53,102 --> 01:12:56,684
There's something I'd like to say.
It's been bothering me a little,

1024
01:12:56,773 --> 01:12:59,061
and as long as we're stuck...

1025
01:12:59,149 --> 01:13:03,017
There was this whole business about
the stab wound and how it was made.

1026
01:13:03,114 --> 01:13:06,645
- The downward angle of it, you know?
- Don't start with that again.

1027
01:13:06,739 --> 01:13:10,653
- They've been over it and over it.
- I know, but I don't go along with it.

1028
01:13:10,745 --> 01:13:14,825
The boy was five feet seven inches tall.
His father was six two.

1029
01:13:14,916 --> 01:13:17,241
That's a difference of seven inches.

1030
01:13:17,336 --> 01:13:21,629
It's very awkward to stab down into the
chest of someone over half a foot taller.

1031
01:13:21,714 --> 01:13:24,168
Give me that.

1032
01:13:24,259 --> 01:13:28,007
I'll give you a demonstration.
Somebody get up.

1033
01:13:35,102 --> 01:13:37,475
Watch this - I don't wanna
have to do it again.

1034
01:13:37,565 --> 01:13:40,434
I'll make myself about
six or seven inches shorter.

1035
01:13:40,526 --> 01:13:44,190
- That's about right. Maybe a little more.
- OK, a little more.

1036
01:13:55,708 --> 01:13:58,198
Now... nobody's hurt.

1037
01:13:59,087 --> 01:14:01,578
- Right?
- Right. Nobody hurt.

1038
01:14:05,553 --> 01:14:10,547
Now, this is the way I'd stab a man
who was... taller than I was.

1039
01:14:10,641 --> 01:14:13,131
Look at the angle. Down and in.

1040
01:14:13,227 --> 01:14:16,975
And this is the way it was done.
Now tell me I'm wrong.

1041
01:14:19,775 --> 01:14:23,024
- Down and in. There's no argument.
- Hold on a minute.

1042
01:14:23,112 --> 01:14:25,186
Will you give me that?

1043
01:14:25,907 --> 01:14:27,982
Boy, I hate these things.

1044
01:14:28,077 --> 01:14:31,243
- Did you ever see a knife fight?
- No.

1045
01:14:31,329 --> 01:14:34,363
Anybody here ever see a knife fight?

1046
01:14:34,457 --> 01:14:39,582
Well, I have. You know, on my back stoop,
the lot across the street, back yard.

1047
01:14:39,671 --> 01:14:42,041
Switchblades came
with the neighbourhood.

1048
01:14:42,132 --> 01:14:45,217
Funny I never thought of it before.
I guess you try to forget.

1049
01:14:45,303 --> 01:14:50,461
- How do you use a switchblade?
- Well, you'd never use it like this.

1050
01:14:50,557 --> 01:14:54,009
See, you'd lose too much time
switching hands.

1051
01:14:54,686 --> 01:14:57,176
Here's how. Underhand.

1052
01:14:59,817 --> 01:15:02,981
Anyone who's ever used one
wouldn't handle it any other way.

1053
01:15:03,069 --> 01:15:05,477
- Are you sure?
- I'm sure.

1054
01:15:05,572 --> 01:15:10,234
- It's why they're made to open like that.
- The boy was pretty handy with a knife?

1055
01:15:10,328 --> 01:15:13,411
You think he could have made
the wound that killed his father?

1056
01:15:13,497 --> 01:15:17,541
No. Not with the experience he got
all his life handling these things.

1057
01:15:17,627 --> 01:15:20,792
- I feel he'd have gone for him underhand.
- How do you know?

1058
01:15:20,880 --> 01:15:24,829
- Were you there when he was killed?
- No. Neither was anybody else.

1059
01:15:24,927 --> 01:15:28,177
What are you giving us this
mumbo jumbo for? I don't believe it.

1060
01:15:28,263 --> 01:15:31,511
I don't think you can tell
what wound he might have made

1061
01:15:31,599 --> 01:15:34,054
simply because he knew
how to handle a knife.

1062
01:15:34,144 --> 01:15:37,261
- What do you think?
- I don't know.

1063
01:15:37,354 --> 01:15:40,770
- What do you mean, you don't know?
- I don't know.

1064
01:15:44,948 --> 01:15:47,816
- How about you?
- I don't know about the rest of 'em,

1065
01:15:47,907 --> 01:15:51,986
but I'm gettin' tired of this
yakety-yakkin'. It's gettin' us nowhere.

1066
01:15:52,080 --> 01:15:56,955
So I guess /'// have to break it up.
I'm changin' my vote to not guilty.

1067
01:15:57,042 --> 01:16:00,078
- You're what?
- You heard me. I've had enough.

1068
01:16:00,171 --> 01:16:05,544
- You've had enough? That's no answer.
- Listen, you just take care of yourself.

1069
01:16:05,633 --> 01:16:08,090
- You know?
- He's right.

1070
01:16:08,471 --> 01:16:10,927
That's not an answer.

1071
01:16:11,015 --> 01:16:13,931
What kind of a man are you?

1072
01:16:14,019 --> 01:16:17,183
You have sat here and voted
guilty with everyone else

1073
01:16:17,271 --> 01:16:21,564
because there are some baseball tickets
burning a hole in your pocket.

1074
01:16:21,651 --> 01:16:26,562
Now you have changed your vote because
you say you're sick of all the talking?

1075
01:16:26,657 --> 01:16:30,440
- Now, listen, buddy...
- Who tells you that you have the right

1076
01:16:30,536 --> 01:16:33,535
to play like this with a man's life?
Don't you care...

1077
01:16:33,622 --> 01:16:36,905
Now, wait a minute.
You can't talk like that to me.

1078
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:41,497
I can talk like that to you.
If you want to vote not guilty,

1079
01:16:41,589 --> 01:16:46,049
do it because you are convinced he is not
guilty, not because you've had enough.

1080
01:16:46,135 --> 01:16:48,920
And if you think he is guilty,
then vote that way.

1081
01:16:49,014 --> 01:16:51,930
Or don't you have the guts
to do what you think is right?

1082
01:16:52,015 --> 01:16:54,968
- Now, listen...
- Guilty or not guilty?

1083
01:16:55,061 --> 01:16:58,679
- I told you. Not guilty.
- Why?

1084
01:17:00,568 --> 01:17:05,313
- Look, I don't have to...
- You do have to. Say it. Why?

1085
01:17:05,404 --> 01:17:07,729
I... I don't think he's guilty.

1086
01:17:17,209 --> 01:17:21,420
- I want another vote.
- OK, that's another vote called for.

1087
01:17:21,504 --> 01:17:24,541
I guess the quickest way
is a show of hands. Anyone object?

1088
01:17:24,634 --> 01:17:27,468
OK, all those voting not guilty,
raise your hands.

1089
01:17:27,845 --> 01:17:29,966
One, two, three,

1090
01:17:30,390 --> 01:17:33,508
four, five, six, seven...

1091
01:17:36,145 --> 01:17:38,219
eight.

1092
01:17:43,111 --> 01:17:45,185
Nine.

1093
01:17:46,864 --> 01:17:50,113
All those voting guilty, raise your hands.

1094
01:17:50,203 --> 01:17:52,489
One, two, three.

1095
01:17:52,579 --> 01:17:56,031
Well, the vote's nine to three
in favour of acquittal.

1096
01:17:56,209 --> 01:17:57,998
I don't understand you people!

1097
01:17:58,085 --> 01:18:02,081
All these picky little points you keep
bringing up, they don't mean nothing!

1098
01:18:02,172 --> 01:18:03,878
You saw this kid just like I did.

1099
01:18:03,965 --> 01:18:07,464
Don't tell me you believe that
phoney story about losing the knife

1100
01:18:07,554 --> 01:18:09,627
and about being at the movies.

1101
01:18:09,721 --> 01:18:12,757
Look, you know how these people lie.
It's born in them.

1102
01:18:12,851 --> 01:18:16,893
What the heck? I don't have to tell you.
They don't know what the truth is!

1103
01:18:16,978 --> 01:18:20,597
And they don't need any real big reason
to kill someone, either.

1104
01:18:20,691 --> 01:18:25,601
No, sir. They get drunk.
They're real big drinkers, all of 'em.

1105
01:18:25,695 --> 01:18:28,780
You know that. And bang!
Someone's lying in the gutter.

1106
01:18:28,868 --> 01:18:31,950
Nobody's blaming 'em.
That's the way they are by nature.

1107
01:18:32,036 --> 01:18:35,534
You know what I mean? Violent.
Where are you going?

1108
01:18:35,623 --> 01:18:39,787
Human life don't mean
as much to them as it does to us.

1109
01:18:39,877 --> 01:18:42,497
They're lushing it up
and fighting all the time,

1110
01:18:42,588 --> 01:18:46,253
and if somebody gets killed,
somebody gets killed! They don't care!

1111
01:18:46,343 --> 01:18:50,388
Sure, there's some good things about 'em,
too. I'm the first one to say that.

1112
01:18:50,472 --> 01:18:54,053
I've known a couple who were OK,
but that's the exception.

1113
01:18:54,142 --> 01:18:57,807
Most of 'em, it's like they have
no feelings! They can do anything!

1114
01:18:57,896 --> 01:18:59,971
What's going on here?

1115
01:19:00,691 --> 01:19:04,735
I'm trying to tell you.
You're making a big mistake, you people.

1116
01:19:04,820 --> 01:19:08,567
This kid is a liar. I know it.
I know all about them.

1117
01:19:09,534 --> 01:19:11,610
Listen to me. They're no good.

1118
01:19:11,703 --> 01:19:14,406
There's not a one of 'em who's any good.

1119
01:19:16,165 --> 01:19:18,655
I mean, what's happening in here?

1120
01:19:18,751 --> 01:19:21,324
I speak my piece, and you...

1121
01:19:22,129 --> 01:19:24,204
Listen to me.

1122
01:19:24,966 --> 01:19:27,458
I... We're... we're...

1123
01:19:27,553 --> 01:19:32,129
This kid on trial here. His type.
Well, don't you know about them?

1124
01:19:32,974 --> 01:19:35,462
There's a... There's a danger here.

1125
01:19:36,519 --> 01:19:38,678
These people are dangerous.

1126
01:19:38,772 --> 01:19:41,059
They're... wild.

1127
01:19:41,984 --> 01:19:44,475
Listen to me. Listen to me.

1128
01:19:45,071 --> 01:19:49,067
I have. Now, sit down
and don't open your mouth again.

1129
01:19:52,997 --> 01:19:55,830
Some of the time... I tell you.

1130
01:20:32,243 --> 01:20:37,748
It's always difficult to keep personal
prejudice out of a thing like this.

1131
01:20:37,833 --> 01:20:43,337
Wherever you run into it,
prejudice always obscures the truth.

1132
01:20:43,423 --> 01:20:45,793
I don't really know what the truth is.

1133
01:20:45,882 --> 01:20:50,094
I don't suppose anybody
will ever really know.

1134
01:20:50,179 --> 01:20:53,963
Nine of us now seem to feel
that the defendant is innocent.

1135
01:20:54,058 --> 01:20:59,182
But we're just gambling on
probabilities. We may be wrong.

1136
01:20:59,272 --> 01:21:05,226
We may be trying to let a guilty man
go free. I don't know. Nobody really can.

1137
01:21:05,320 --> 01:21:07,607
But we have a reasonable doubt.

1138
01:21:07,698 --> 01:21:11,446
And that's something
that's very valuable in our system.

1139
01:21:11,535 --> 01:21:16,160
No jury can declare a man guilty
unless it's sure.

1140
01:21:17,292 --> 01:21:22,665
We nine can't understand
how you three are still so sure.

1141
01:21:23,673 --> 01:21:26,163
- Maybe you can tell us.
- I'll try.

1142
01:21:27,010 --> 01:21:30,671
You've made some excellent points,
but I still believe the boy is guilty.

1143
01:21:30,762 --> 01:21:35,223
I have two reasons. One: The evidence
given by the woman across the street,

1144
01:21:35,311 --> 01:21:38,145
who actually saw the murder committed.

1145
01:21:38,230 --> 01:21:40,934
That's the most important testimony.

1146
01:21:41,025 --> 01:21:43,645
And two: The fact that
she described the stabbing

1147
01:21:43,736 --> 01:21:46,854
by saying she saw the boy
raise his arm over his head

1148
01:21:46,946 --> 01:21:49,864
and stab down into the father's chest.

1149
01:21:49,950 --> 01:21:53,946
- She saw him do it, the wrong way.
- That's absolutely right.

1150
01:21:54,412 --> 01:21:56,819
Let's talk about this woman for a moment.

1151
01:21:56,916 --> 01:22:00,081
She said she went to bed
about eleven o'clock that night.

1152
01:22:00,168 --> 01:22:03,501
Her bed was next to the window,
and she could look out

1153
01:22:03,589 --> 01:22:07,716
and see directly into
the boy's room across the street.

1154
01:22:07,801 --> 01:22:10,337
She tossed and turned for over an hour.

1155
01:22:10,428 --> 01:22:14,591
Finally, she turned toward the window
at about 10 minutes after 12,

1156
01:22:14,684 --> 01:22:20,022
and as she looked out, she saw the killing
through the windows of a passing el train.

1157
01:22:20,106 --> 01:22:22,512
She said the lights went out
after the killing,

1158
01:22:22,607 --> 01:22:28,396
but that she got a good look at the boy
in the act of stabbing his father.

1159
01:22:28,489 --> 01:22:33,030
As far as I can see it,
this is unshakeable testimony.

1160
01:22:33,119 --> 01:22:36,653
- Well, that's the whole case.
- What do you think?

1161
01:22:41,337 --> 01:22:43,412
How about you?

1162
01:22:44,713 --> 01:22:51,000
I don't know. So much evidence to sift.
This is a pretty complicated business.

1163
01:22:51,096 --> 01:22:55,046
Frankly, I don't see how
you can vote for acquittal.

1164
01:22:55,143 --> 01:22:59,305
- It's not so easy to arrange the evidence.
- Throw out all the other evidence!

1165
01:22:59,396 --> 01:23:03,013
The woman saw him do it!
What else do you want?

1166
01:23:03,108 --> 01:23:05,266
- Well, maybe...
- Let's vote on it.

1167
01:23:05,361 --> 01:23:09,228
OK, there's another vote called for.
Anyone object?

1168
01:23:09,325 --> 01:23:11,565
All right. I'm changing my vote.

1169
01:23:11,658 --> 01:23:14,861
- He's guilty.
- Anybody else? The vote is eight to four.

1170
01:23:14,955 --> 01:23:18,487
Why is this such a personal triumph
for you, this one vote?

1171
01:23:18,581 --> 01:23:22,033
OK. I say we're a hung jury.
I say we take it in to the judge.

1172
01:23:22,129 --> 01:23:25,045
How about it? I wanna hear arguments.

1173
01:23:25,131 --> 01:23:28,878
You, you're the leader of the cause.
What about it?

1174
01:23:29,760 --> 01:23:33,545
- Let's go over it again.
- We've been over it again.

1175
01:23:33,641 --> 01:23:38,432
The boy in the grey flannel suit is
bouncin' back and forth like a tennis ball.

1176
01:23:38,520 --> 01:23:43,975
There's no point in getting nasty.
You keep trying to turn this into a contest.

1177
01:23:44,610 --> 01:23:45,687
OK.

1178
01:23:45,776 --> 01:23:48,861
Maybe we can talk about
setting some kind of time limit.

1179
01:23:48,949 --> 01:23:51,865
Yeah. Once around for the deal, huh?

1180
01:23:51,952 --> 01:23:57,787
It's... a quarter after six. Someone
before mentioned seven o'clock.

1181
01:23:57,875 --> 01:24:03,579
That's a point at which we might begin to
discuss whether we're a hung jury or not.

1182
01:24:03,671 --> 01:24:08,546
- Don't you feel well?
- I feel perfectly well, thank you.

1183
01:24:08,634 --> 01:24:11,589
I was saying seven o'clock
would be a reasonable time...

1184
01:24:11,682 --> 01:24:15,926
The reason I asked that was because
you were rubbing your nose like...

1185
01:24:16,017 --> 01:24:18,684
Oh, I'm sorry for interrupting.

1186
01:24:18,770 --> 01:24:22,186
But you made a gesture
that reminded me of something.

1187
01:24:22,274 --> 01:24:27,183
- I'm trying to settle something here.
- Well, I think this is important.

1188
01:24:27,405 --> 01:24:31,782
Thank you. Now, then.
I'm sure you'll pardon me for this,

1189
01:24:31,867 --> 01:24:34,903
but I was wondering why
you rub your nose like that.

1190
01:24:34,995 --> 01:24:36,274
Come on, will you?

1191
01:24:36,371 --> 01:24:40,831
At this point I happen to be talking
to the gentleman sitting next to you.

1192
01:24:40,918 --> 01:24:44,333
Now, why were you
rubbing your nose like that?

1193
01:24:44,421 --> 01:24:48,335
If it's any of your business, I was
rubbing it because it bothers me a little.

1194
01:24:48,426 --> 01:24:52,422
Oh, I'm sorry. Is it...
Is it because of your eyeglasses?

1195
01:24:52,513 --> 01:24:56,048
It is. Now could we get on
to something else?

1196
01:24:56,142 --> 01:25:00,683
Your eyeglasses made those two deep
impressions on the sides of your nose.

1197
01:25:00,771 --> 01:25:04,355
I hadn't noticed that before.
That must be annoying.

1198
01:25:04,442 --> 01:25:06,516
It is very annoying.

1199
01:25:06,611 --> 01:25:12,034
I wouldn't know about that.
I've never worn eyeglasses. 20/20.

1200
01:25:12,117 --> 01:25:16,327
Listen, will you come on already
with the optometrist bit?

1201
01:25:16,413 --> 01:25:20,078
The woman who testified
that she saw the killing

1202
01:25:20,169 --> 01:25:24,379
had those same marks
on the sides of her nose.

1203
01:25:24,463 --> 01:25:26,537
Holy smoke! He's right.

1204
01:25:26,631 --> 01:25:32,335
Please. Just give me a minute...
and I'll be finished.

1205
01:25:32,428 --> 01:25:35,382
I don't know if anyone else
noticed that about her.

1206
01:25:35,474 --> 01:25:42,389
I didn't think of it then, but I've been
going over her face... in my mind.

1207
01:25:42,482 --> 01:25:46,728
She had those same marks.
She kept rubbing them in court.

1208
01:25:47,153 --> 01:25:50,568
He's right. She did do that a lot.

1209
01:25:50,657 --> 01:25:54,441
This woman was about 45 years old.

1210
01:25:55,453 --> 01:25:59,449
She was making
a tremendous effort to look 35.

1211
01:25:59,541 --> 01:26:05,081
For her first public appearance.
Heavy make-up. Dyed hair.

1212
01:26:05,173 --> 01:26:09,004
Brand-new clothes that should have
been worn by a younger woman.

1213
01:26:09,093 --> 01:26:15,045
No glasses. Well, women do that.
See if you can get a mental picture of her.

1214
01:26:15,139 --> 01:26:18,674
What do you mean, no glasses? How do
you know whether she wore glasses?

1215
01:26:18,770 --> 01:26:22,138
- Just cos she was rubbin' her nose?
- She had those marks. I saw 'em.

1216
01:26:22,232 --> 01:26:25,601
- So? What do you think that means?
- I'm sick of your yellin'...

1217
01:26:25,695 --> 01:26:27,186
Come on. Forget it.

1218
01:26:27,278 --> 01:26:31,855
Hey, listen. Listen, he's right. I saw
them too. I was the closest one to her.

1219
01:26:31,949 --> 01:26:35,033
She had these things
on the side of her nose.

1220
01:26:35,329 --> 01:26:37,036
What point are you makin'?

1221
01:26:37,123 --> 01:26:40,739
She had dyed hair, marks on her nose.
What does that mean?

1222
01:26:40,834 --> 01:26:45,413
Could those marks be made
by anything other than eyeglasses?

1223
01:26:48,841 --> 01:26:50,964
No. They couldn't.

1224
01:26:51,053 --> 01:26:53,542
I didn't see any marks!

1225
01:26:55,016 --> 01:26:59,144
I did. Strange,
but I didn't think about it before.

1226
01:26:59,228 --> 01:27:01,469
Why didn't the lawyer say something?

1227
01:27:01,565 --> 01:27:04,517
There are twelve people in here
concentrating on this case.

1228
01:27:04,608 --> 01:27:08,309
- Eleven of us didn't think of it either.
- What about the district attorney?

1229
01:27:08,405 --> 01:27:11,937
You think he'd pull that?
Have her testify without her glasses?

1230
01:27:12,032 --> 01:27:16,280
Ever see a woman who didn't want to
wear them because they spoil her looks?

1231
01:27:16,371 --> 01:27:21,162
OK. She had marks on her nose.
I'm givin' you that.

1232
01:27:21,251 --> 01:27:24,584
From glasses, right? She didn't
wanna wear 'em out of the house

1233
01:27:24,671 --> 01:27:27,705
so people'd think she's gorgeous.

1234
01:27:27,799 --> 01:27:32,126
But when she saw this kid killin'
his father, she was in the house alone.

1235
01:27:32,219 --> 01:27:34,296
That's all.

1236
01:27:34,431 --> 01:27:36,887
Do you wear glasses when you go to bed?

1237
01:27:36,976 --> 01:27:39,050
No. I don't.

1238
01:27:40,103 --> 01:27:42,142
No one wears eyeglasses to bed.

1239
01:27:42,231 --> 01:27:46,808
It's logical to assume
that she wasn't wearing them in bed.

1240
01:27:46,902 --> 01:27:49,357
- How do you know?
- I don't know. I'm guessing.

1241
01:27:49,448 --> 01:27:54,109
I'm also guessing that she didn't put them
on when she looked out of the window.

1242
01:27:54,202 --> 01:27:57,319
She testified the killing
took place just as she looked out.

1243
01:27:57,412 --> 01:28:00,413
The lights went off.
She didn't have time to put them on.

1244
01:28:00,499 --> 01:28:04,366
Here's another guess. She honestly
thought she saw the boy kill his father.

1245
01:28:04,461 --> 01:28:07,961
- I say she only saw a blur.
- How do you know what she saw?

1246
01:28:08,051 --> 01:28:11,547
How does he know all that? How
do you know what glasses she wore?

1247
01:28:11,636 --> 01:28:15,551
Maybe they were sunglasses! Maybe
she was far-sighted! What do you know?

1248
01:28:15,640 --> 01:28:18,640
I only know the woman's eyesight
is in question now.

1249
01:28:18,727 --> 01:28:24,765
She had to be able to identify a person
60 feet away, at night, without glasses.

1250
01:28:24,859 --> 01:28:27,858
You can't send someone off
to die on evidence like that.

1251
01:28:27,945 --> 01:28:29,437
Aw, don't give me that.

1252
01:28:29,530 --> 01:28:32,530
- Might she not have made a mistake?
- No.

1253
01:28:32,742 --> 01:28:35,777
- It's not possible?
- No, it's not possible.

1254
01:28:39,039 --> 01:28:41,114
Is it possible?

1255
01:28:42,001 --> 01:28:44,075
Not guilty.

1256
01:28:47,800 --> 01:28:50,419
Do you think he's guilty?

1257
01:28:50,510 --> 01:28:52,797
I think he's guilty.

1258
01:28:55,306 --> 01:28:57,380
Do you?

1259
01:28:59,645 --> 01:29:01,137
No.

1260
01:29:01,229 --> 01:29:04,264
I'm convinced. Not guilty.

1261
01:29:04,359 --> 01:29:08,308
- What's the matter with you?
- I have a reasonable doubt now.

1262
01:29:08,404 --> 01:29:11,486
- It's eleven to one.
- What about all the other evidence?

1263
01:29:11,571 --> 01:29:15,155
What about all that stuff? The...
The knife? The whole business?

1264
01:29:15,244 --> 01:29:19,324
Well, you said we could
throw out all the other evidence.

1265
01:29:23,920 --> 01:29:26,409
Well, what do we do now?

1266
01:29:29,258 --> 01:29:31,131
You're alone.

1267
01:29:31,218 --> 01:29:35,512
I don't care whether I'm alone or not.
It's my right.

1268
01:29:37,851 --> 01:29:39,841
It's your right.

1269
01:29:49,322 --> 01:29:52,274
Well, what do you want? I say he's guilty.

1270
01:29:53,116 --> 01:29:57,326
- We want to hear your arguments.
- I gave you my arguments.

1271
01:29:57,745 --> 01:30:01,492
We're not convinced.
We want to hear them again.

1272
01:30:02,625 --> 01:30:05,412
We have as much time as it takes.

1273
01:30:10,384 --> 01:30:16,717
Everything-every single thing that took
place in that courtroom says he's guilty.

1274
01:30:16,807 --> 01:30:19,926
What do you think?
I'm an idiot or somethin'?

1275
01:30:20,979 --> 01:30:26,682
Take that stuff about the old man,
who lived there and heard everything!

1276
01:30:27,944 --> 01:30:31,608
Or this business about the knife.
They found another one exactly like it?

1277
01:30:31,698 --> 01:30:35,196
The old man saw him!
Right there, on the stairs.

1278
01:30:35,285 --> 01:30:38,903
What's the difference
how many seconds it was?

1279
01:30:39,415 --> 01:30:45,666
Every single thing. The knife
fallin' through a hole in his pocket.

1280
01:30:45,754 --> 01:30:49,419
You can't prove he didn't get to the door!

1281
01:30:49,508 --> 01:30:54,253
Sure, you can take all the time, hobble
around the room, but you can't prove it!

1282
01:30:56,807 --> 01:30:59,842
And what about this business of the el?
And the movies?

1283
01:30:59,935 --> 01:31:03,221
There's a phoney deal if I ever heard one.

1284
01:31:03,315 --> 01:31:07,312
I'll bet you $5,000
/'d remember the movies I saw.

1285
01:31:07,403 --> 01:31:13,604
I'm tellin' you, everything that's gone on
has been twisted and turned!

1286
01:31:13,699 --> 01:31:17,399
This business with the glasses?
How do you know she didn't have 'em on?

1287
01:31:17,495 --> 01:31:20,864
This woman testified in open court!

1288
01:31:21,626 --> 01:31:25,490
And what about
hearin' the kid yell? Huh?

1289
01:31:25,586 --> 01:31:29,750
I'm tellin' ya, I've got all the facts here.

1290
01:31:30,175 --> 01:31:32,249
Here...

1291
01:31:34,305 --> 01:31:37,638
Well, that's it. That's the whole case.

1292
01:31:44,105 --> 01:31:46,180
Well?

1293
01:31:47,943 --> 01:31:50,019
Say something!

1294
01:31:55,034 --> 01:31:58,403
You lousy bunch of bleedin' hearts.

1295
01:31:59,204 --> 01:32:04,449
You're not gonna intimidate me.
I'm entitled to my opinion.

1296
01:32:07,005 --> 01:32:10,751
Rotten kids... You work your life out!

1297
01:32:22,646 --> 01:32:24,719
No...

1298
01:32:28,275 --> 01:32:30,351
Not guilty.

1299
01:32:33,575 --> 01:32:35,650
Not guilty.

1300
01:32:51,093 --> 01:32:53,168
We're ready now.

1301
01:34:46,086 --> 01:34:48,161
Hey!

1302
01:34:52,386 --> 01:34:55,385
- What's your name?
- Davis.

1303
01:34:55,470 --> 01:34:57,545
My name's McCardle.

1304
01:34:59,850 --> 01:35:02,554
- Well, so long.
- So long.
