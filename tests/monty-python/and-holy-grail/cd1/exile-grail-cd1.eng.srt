1
00:04:08,305 --> 00:04:09,647
Whoa there!

2
00:04:26,487 --> 00:04:28,480
Halt!

3
00:04:28,558 --> 00:04:30,436
Who goes there?

4
00:04:30,515 --> 00:04:34,849
It is I, Arthur, son of Uther Pendragon
from the castle of Camelot.

5
00:04:34,926 --> 00:04:38,185
King of the Britons!
Defeater of the Saxons!

6
00:04:38,263 --> 00:04:40,602
Sovereign of all England!

7
00:04:41,984 --> 00:04:44,630
- Pull the other one.
- I am.

8
00:04:44,707 --> 00:04:46,931
This is my trusty servant Patsy.

9
00:04:47,009 --> 00:04:49,348
We have ridden the length
and breadth of the land...

10
00:04:49,388 --> 00:04:52,762
in search of knights who will join me
in my court at Camelot.

11
00:04:52,839 --> 00:04:55,332
I must speak with your lord and master.

12
00:04:55,410 --> 00:04:58,094
- What, ridden on a horse?
- Yes.

13
00:04:58,171 --> 00:04:59,551
You're using coconuts.

14
00:04:59,629 --> 00:05:04,039
- What?
- You're banging together two coconuts.

15
00:05:04,117 --> 00:05:08,105
So? We have ridden since the snows
of winter covered this land.

16
00:05:08,183 --> 00:05:10,023
Through the kingdom of Mercia--

17
00:05:10,101 --> 00:05:14,051
- Where'd you get the coconuts?
- We found them.

18
00:05:14,129 --> 00:05:16,659
In Mercia?
The coconut's tropical.

19
00:05:16,737 --> 00:05:19,037
- What do you mean?
- This is a temperate zone.

20
00:05:19,115 --> 00:05:21,645
The swallow may
fly south with the sun...

21
00:05:21,723 --> 00:05:25,174
or the house martin or the plover
may seek warmer climes in winter...

22
00:05:25,253 --> 00:05:27,400
yet these are not strangers
to our land.

23
00:05:27,478 --> 00:05:30,507
Are you suggesting coconuts migrate?

24
00:05:30,584 --> 00:05:32,884
Not at all.
They could be carried.

25
00:05:32,963 --> 00:05:35,839
What? A swallow carrying a coconut?

26
00:05:35,879 --> 00:05:37,604
It could grip it by the husk.

27
00:05:37,681 --> 00:05:40,288
It's not a question
of where he grips it.

28
00:05:40,328 --> 00:05:42,858
It's a simple question of weight ratios.

29
00:05:42,936 --> 00:05:47,002
A five-ounce bird could not carry
a one-pound coconut.

30
00:05:47,079 --> 00:05:48,421
It doesn't matter.

31
00:05:48,499 --> 00:05:52,027
Tell your master that Arthur
from the court of Camelot is here.

32
00:05:53,102 --> 00:05:55,978
In order to maintain
air speed velocity...

33
00:05:56,055 --> 00:06:00,849
a swallow needs to beat its wings
43 times every second.

34
00:06:00,927 --> 00:06:02,115
Please!

35
00:06:02,192 --> 00:06:04,914
- Am I right?
- I'm not interested.

36
00:06:04,993 --> 00:06:07,486
It could be carried
by an atrican swallow.

37
00:06:07,563 --> 00:06:12,127
An atrican swallow, maybe,
but not a European swallow.

38
00:06:12,166 --> 00:06:14,428
- That's my point.
- I agree with that.

39
00:06:14,468 --> 00:06:18,380
Will you ask your master if he wants
to join my court at Camelot?

40
00:06:19,263 --> 00:06:23,021
But then, of course,
atrican swallows are nonmigratory.

41
00:06:23,099 --> 00:06:25,860
So they couldn't bring
a coconut back anyway.

42
00:06:25,937 --> 00:06:29,772
Wait a minute. Supposing two swallows
carried it together!

43
00:06:29,850 --> 00:06:31,806
No, they'd have to have it on a Iine.

44
00:06:31,844 --> 00:06:34,835
Simple. They just use
a strand of creeper.

45
00:06:34,913 --> 00:06:38,287
-Held under the dorsal guiding feathers?
-Why not?

46
00:06:40,168 --> 00:06:42,276
Bring out your dead!

47
00:06:57,967 --> 00:06:59,884
Bring out your dead!

48
00:07:12,159 --> 00:07:13,501
Ninepence.

49
00:07:33,487 --> 00:07:35,327
- Here's one.
- Ninepence.

50
00:07:35,406 --> 00:07:37,246
- I'm not dead!
- What?

51
00:07:37,323 --> 00:07:39,777
- Nothing. Here's our ninepence.
- I'm not dead!

52
00:07:39,855 --> 00:07:42,041
- Here. He says he's not dead.
- Yes, he is.

53
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:43,957
- I'm not.
- He isn't?

54
00:07:43,998 --> 00:07:46,106
- He will be soon. He's ill.
- I'm getting better.

55
00:07:46,146 --> 00:07:48,024
You'll be stone dead in a moment.

56
00:07:48,064 --> 00:07:50,594
I can't take him Iike that.
It's against regulations.

57
00:07:50,672 --> 00:07:53,816
- I don't want to go on the cart!
- Don't be such a baby.

58
00:07:53,856 --> 00:07:56,042
- I can't take him.
- I feel fine.

59
00:07:56,119 --> 00:07:58,075
- Do us a favor.
- I can't.

60
00:07:58,152 --> 00:08:00,184
Can you hang around?
He won't be long.

61
00:08:00,224 --> 00:08:03,024
I've got to get to Robinson's.
They've lost nine today.

62
00:08:03,101 --> 00:08:05,133
- When is your next round?
- Thursday.

63
00:08:05,211 --> 00:08:08,662
- I think I'lI go for a walk.
- You're not tooling anyone.

64
00:08:08,701 --> 00:08:11,999
- lsn't there something you can do?
- I feeI happy!

65
00:08:14,953 --> 00:08:17,753
- Thanks very much.
- Not at all. See you on Thursday.

66
00:08:22,395 --> 00:08:25,654
- Who's that?
- I don't know. Must be a king.

67
00:08:25,694 --> 00:08:29,222
- Why?
- He hasn't got shit all over him.

68
00:08:51,088 --> 00:08:53,005
- Old woman !
- Man !

69
00:08:53,083 --> 00:08:56,496
Man. Sorry.
What knight lives in that castle there?

70
00:08:56,573 --> 00:08:58,873
- I'm 37.
- What?

71
00:08:58,913 --> 00:09:01,328
I'm 37. I'm not old.

72
00:09:01,407 --> 00:09:04,322
- I can't just call you "man."
- You could say "Dennis."

73
00:09:04,398 --> 00:09:07,274
- I didn't know you were called Dennis.
- You didn't bother to find out.

74
00:09:07,352 --> 00:09:10,036
I said "Sorry" about the old woman,
but from behind, you looked--

75
00:09:10,114 --> 00:09:13,220
What I object to is that you
automatically treat me like an interior.

76
00:09:13,298 --> 00:09:16,020
- I am king.
- Oh, king. Very nice.

77
00:09:16,059 --> 00:09:19,703
And how'd you get that?
By expIoiting the workers.

78
00:09:19,781 --> 00:09:22,159
By hanging on to
outdated imperialist dogma...

79
00:09:22,235 --> 00:09:26,031
which perpetuates the economic
and social differences in our society.

80
00:09:26,071 --> 00:09:30,980
- If there's ever going to be progress--
- There's lovely filth down here.

81
00:09:31,058 --> 00:09:33,282
- How do you do?
- How do you do, good lady?

82
00:09:33,359 --> 00:09:36,618
I'm Arthur, king of the Britons.
Whose castle is that?

83
00:09:36,696 --> 00:09:38,652
- King of who?
- The Britons.

84
00:09:38,730 --> 00:09:42,987
-Who are the Britons?
-We are all Britons, and I am your king.

85
00:09:43,064 --> 00:09:46,708
I didn't know we had a king. I thought
we were an autonomous collective.

86
00:09:46,747 --> 00:09:49,776
You're tooling yourself.
We're living in a dictatorship.

87
00:09:49,816 --> 00:09:53,075
A self-perpetuating autocracy
in which the working classes--

88
00:09:53,115 --> 00:09:55,339
There you go bringing class
into it again.

89
00:09:55,416 --> 00:09:57,256
That's what it's all about.

90
00:09:57,334 --> 00:10:01,591
Please, good people. I am in haste.
Who lives in that castle?

91
00:10:01,630 --> 00:10:03,470
No one lives there.

92
00:10:03,510 --> 00:10:05,696
- Then who is your lord?
- We don't have a lord.

93
00:10:05,773 --> 00:10:06,961
What?

94
00:10:07,038 --> 00:10:09,607
We're an anarcho-syndicalist commune.

95
00:10:09,686 --> 00:10:13,713
We take turns to act as sort of
an executive officer for the week.

96
00:10:13,790 --> 00:10:16,244
But alI the decisions
of that officer have to be ratified...

97
00:10:16,321 --> 00:10:18,545
at a special biweekly meeting...

98
00:10:18,623 --> 00:10:21,921
by a simple majority
in the case of internal atfairs.

99
00:10:21,999 --> 00:10:24,568
- But by 2/3rd's majority--
- Be quiet!

100
00:10:24,646 --> 00:10:28,020
- I order you to be quiet!
- Order? Who does he think he is?

101
00:10:28,098 --> 00:10:31,281
- I am your king.
- I didn't vote for you.

102
00:10:31,321 --> 00:10:34,887
- You don't vote for kings.
- How'd you become king, then?

103
00:10:34,965 --> 00:10:36,805
The Lady of the Lake...

104
00:10:36,882 --> 00:10:39,797
her arm clad in the purest
shimmering samite...

105
00:10:39,875 --> 00:10:43,288
held alott Excalibur
from the bosom of the water...

106
00:10:43,365 --> 00:10:45,321
signifying by Divine Providence...

107
00:10:45,398 --> 00:10:48,466
that I, Arthur,
was to carry Excalibur.

108
00:10:48,543 --> 00:10:50,383
That is why I am your king.

109
00:10:50,461 --> 00:10:53,683
Strange women lying in ponds,
distributing swords...

110
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,600
is no basis for government.

111
00:10:55,678 --> 00:10:59,590
Supreme executive power derives
from a mandate from the masses...

112
00:10:59,668 --> 00:11:02,046
not from some farcical aquatic ceremony.

113
00:11:02,122 --> 00:11:03,157
Quiet!

114
00:11:03,235 --> 00:11:06,686
You can't expect to wield
supreme executive power...

115
00:11:06,764 --> 00:11:08,835
because some watery tart
threw a sword at you.

116
00:11:08,912 --> 00:11:09,870
Shut up!

117
00:11:09,948 --> 00:11:11,980
If I went around saying
I was an emperor...

118
00:11:12,019 --> 00:11:16,199
just because some moistened bint lobbed
a scimitar at me, they'd put me away.

119
00:11:16,277 --> 00:11:18,348
Shut up!
Will you shut up?

120
00:11:18,425 --> 00:11:20,457
Now we see the violence
inherent in the system.

121
00:11:20,535 --> 00:11:21,992
Shut up!

122
00:11:22,031 --> 00:11:26,058
Come see the violence inherent in
the system. Help! I'm being repressed!

123
00:11:26,097 --> 00:11:29,395
- Bloody peasant!
- What a giveaway! Did you hear that?

124
00:11:29,473 --> 00:11:32,425
That's what I'm on about.
Did you see him repressing me?

125
00:13:05,255 --> 00:13:08,092
You fight with the strength
of many men, Sir Knight.

126
00:13:11,163 --> 00:13:13,578
I am Arthur, king of the Britons.

127
00:13:17,415 --> 00:13:19,908
I seek the finest and bravest knights
in the land...

128
00:13:19,985 --> 00:13:22,171
to join me at Camelot.

129
00:13:27,005 --> 00:13:30,495
You have proved yourself worthy.
Will you join me?

130
00:13:35,635 --> 00:13:38,894
You make me sad. So be it.
Come, Patsy.

131
00:13:38,973 --> 00:13:41,120
- None shall pass.
- What?

132
00:13:41,198 --> 00:13:43,000
None shall pass.

133
00:13:43,078 --> 00:13:47,066
I have no quarrel with you,
but I must cross this bridge.

134
00:13:47,144 --> 00:13:49,559
Then you shall die.

135
00:13:49,637 --> 00:13:54,201
I command you, as king of the Britons,
to stand aside!

136
00:13:54,278 --> 00:13:58,151
I move for no man.

137
00:13:59,264 --> 00:14:00,644
So be it!

138
00:14:25,733 --> 00:14:29,529
- Now stand aside, worthy adversary.
- 'Tis but a scratch.

139
00:14:29,607 --> 00:14:32,100
- A scratch? Your arm's off.
- No, it isn't.

140
00:14:32,177 --> 00:14:35,436
- What's that, then?
- I've had worse.

141
00:14:35,514 --> 00:14:37,431
- You liar!
- Come on, you pansy!

142
00:14:45,450 --> 00:14:48,030
Victory is mine.

143
00:14:48,106 --> 00:14:50,647
We thank Thee, Lord,
that in Thy mercy--

144
00:14:51,765 --> 00:14:53,728
- Come on.
- What?

145
00:14:53,807 --> 00:14:55,693
Have at you!

146
00:14:56,811 --> 00:14:59,044
You are indeed brave,
but the fight is mine.

147
00:14:59,122 --> 00:15:01,431
Had enough, eh?

148
00:15:01,509 --> 00:15:04,012
You stupid bastard,
you've got no arms left.

149
00:15:04,091 --> 00:15:05,939
- Yes, I have.
- Look!

150
00:15:06,016 --> 00:15:08,403
It's just a flesh wound.

151
00:15:08,481 --> 00:15:10,829
- Stop that!
- Chicken!

152
00:15:10,907 --> 00:15:13,834
I'll have your leg! Right!

153
00:15:15,375 --> 00:15:17,454
- Right!
- I'll do you for that.

154
00:15:17,531 --> 00:15:19,494
- You'll what?
- Come here.

155
00:15:19,573 --> 00:15:22,808
- Are you going to bleed on me?
- I'm invincible!

156
00:15:22,846 --> 00:15:24,154
You're loony.

157
00:15:24,195 --> 00:15:27,159
The Black Knight always triumphs!

158
00:15:27,237 --> 00:15:29,740
Have at you!
Come on, then.

159
00:15:35,402 --> 00:15:38,251
All right, we'll call it a draw.

160
00:15:38,291 --> 00:15:40,062
Come, Patsy.

161
00:15:40,139 --> 00:15:42,564
I see. Running away, eh?

162
00:15:42,643 --> 00:15:47,379
You yellow bastards! Come back here
and take what's coming to you !

163
00:15:47,419 --> 00:15:49,305
I'll bite your legs off!

164
00:16:23,468 --> 00:16:25,393
A witch! A witch!

165
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:30,092
A witch! We found a witch !

166
00:16:32,596 --> 00:16:35,868
We've got a witch!
A witch! A witch!

167
00:16:45,537 --> 00:16:48,078
We have found a witch.
May we burn her?

168
00:16:50,775 --> 00:16:53,971
- How do you know she is a witch?
- She looks like one.

169
00:16:55,628 --> 00:16:57,861
Bring her forward.

170
00:16:57,939 --> 00:17:00,364
I'm not a witch!
I'm not a witch !

171
00:17:00,442 --> 00:17:02,405
But you are dressed as one.

172
00:17:02,484 --> 00:17:05,179
- They dressed me like this.
- No, we didn't.

173
00:17:05,256 --> 00:17:08,144
And this isn't my nose.
It's a false one.

174
00:17:11,188 --> 00:17:14,076
- Well?
- We did do the nose.

175
00:17:14,153 --> 00:17:17,618
- The nose?
- And the hat. But she is a witch !

176
00:17:21,086 --> 00:17:24,629
- Did you dress her up like this?
- No, no!

177
00:17:24,668 --> 00:17:27,556
Yes. A bit.

178
00:17:27,595 --> 00:17:29,867
She has got a wart.

179
00:17:29,945 --> 00:17:31,946
What makes you think
she's a witch?

180
00:17:32,024 --> 00:17:33,910
She turned me into a newt!

181
00:17:35,028 --> 00:17:36,260
A newt?

182
00:17:40,189 --> 00:17:41,767
I got better.

183
00:17:41,845 --> 00:17:43,693
Burn her anyway!

184
00:17:47,044 --> 00:17:49,777
Quiet! Quiet!

185
00:17:49,856 --> 00:17:53,052
There are ways of teIling
whether she is a witch.

186
00:17:53,130 --> 00:17:57,212
- Are there? What are they? Tell us.
- Do they hurt?

187
00:17:57,289 --> 00:18:00,061
Tell me, what do you do with witches?

188
00:18:00,139 --> 00:18:01,486
Burn them!

189
00:18:03,029 --> 00:18:05,646
And what do you burn,
apart from witches?

190
00:18:05,724 --> 00:18:08,920
- More witches!
- Wood!

191
00:18:08,998 --> 00:18:11,847
So why do witches burn?

192
00:18:22,632 --> 00:18:25,019
- 'Cause they're made of wood?
- Good!

193
00:18:27,870 --> 00:18:32,837
- How do we tell if she is made of wood?
- Build a bridge out of her.

194
00:18:32,876 --> 00:18:36,419
But can you not also make bridges
out of stone?

195
00:18:37,345 --> 00:18:38,730
Oh, yeah.

196
00:18:39,578 --> 00:18:42,697
Does wood sink in water?

197
00:18:42,736 --> 00:18:45,700
- No, it floats.
- Throw her into the pond!

198
00:18:49,053 --> 00:18:51,825
What also floats in water?

199
00:18:51,864 --> 00:18:54,059
- Bread.
- Apples.

200
00:18:54,136 --> 00:18:57,139
- Very small rocks.
- Cider! Great gravy.

201
00:18:57,218 --> 00:18:59,335
- Cherries. Mud.
- Churches.

202
00:18:59,413 --> 00:19:01,261
- Lead.
- A duck!

203
00:19:03,457 --> 00:19:04,842
Exactly.

204
00:19:06,230 --> 00:19:08,193
So, logically--

205
00:19:08,271 --> 00:19:12,969
If she weighs the same as a duck...

206
00:19:15,281 --> 00:19:16,782
she's made of wood.

207
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:18,284
And therefore?

208
00:19:20,326 --> 00:19:21,519
A witch!

209
00:19:24,332 --> 00:19:26,488
- A duck! A duck!
- Here's a duck.

210
00:19:26,566 --> 00:19:28,683
We shaIl use my largest scales.

211
00:19:35,655 --> 00:19:37,541
Burn the witch !

212
00:19:48,982 --> 00:19:52,640
Remove the supports!

213
00:19:56,376 --> 00:19:57,761
A witch!

214
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:59,533
It's a fair cop.

215
00:20:08,046 --> 00:20:11,203
Who are you, who are so wise
in the ways of science?

216
00:20:11,282 --> 00:20:13,620
I am Arthur, king of the Britons.

217
00:20:13,696 --> 00:20:15,651
My Liege!

218
00:20:15,729 --> 00:20:18,297
Good Sir Knight, will you come with me
to Camelot...

219
00:20:18,375 --> 00:20:20,981
and join us at the Round Table?

220
00:20:21,058 --> 00:20:23,550
My Liege, I would be honored!

221
00:20:23,627 --> 00:20:26,502
- What is your name?
- Bedevere, my Liege.

222
00:20:26,579 --> 00:20:29,913
Then I dub you Sir Bedevere...

223
00:20:29,991 --> 00:20:32,367
Knight of the Round Table.

224
00:20:32,446 --> 00:20:36,930
The wise Sir Bedevere was the first
to join King Arthur's knights.

225
00:20:37,008 --> 00:20:40,189
But other illustrious names
were soon to follow.

226
00:20:40,229 --> 00:20:42,835
Sir Lancelot the Brave.

227
00:20:42,912 --> 00:20:45,480
Sir Galahad the Pure.

228
00:20:45,558 --> 00:20:48,433
And Sir Robin the
Not-Quite-So-Brave-As Sir Lancelot...

229
00:20:48,510 --> 00:20:50,580
who had nearly fought
the Dragon of Angnor...

230
00:20:50,657 --> 00:20:53,570
who nearly stood up to
the Chicken of Bristol...

231
00:20:53,648 --> 00:20:57,366
and personally wet himself at
the Battle of Badon Hill.

232
00:20:57,405 --> 00:21:02,043
And the aptly named,
Sir Not-Appearing-In-This-Film.

233
00:21:02,121 --> 00:21:05,226
Together they formed a band
whose names and deeds...

234
00:21:05,265 --> 00:21:07,679
were retold throughout the centuries!

235
00:21:07,757 --> 00:21:10,171
The knights of the Round Table.

236
00:21:10,249 --> 00:21:13,891
And that, my Liege, is how we know
the Earth to be banana-shaped.

237
00:21:13,968 --> 00:21:16,267
This new learning amazes me.

238
00:21:16,345 --> 00:21:20,025
Explain again how sheeps' bladders
may be employed to prevent earthquakes.

239
00:21:20,103 --> 00:21:22,173
- Certainly, sir.
- Look, my Liege!

240
00:21:25,739 --> 00:21:27,885
- Camelot!
- Camelot!

241
00:21:28,806 --> 00:21:30,683
It's only a model.

242
00:21:31,414 --> 00:21:34,097
Knights, I bid you welcome
to your new home.

243
00:21:34,174 --> 00:21:36,934
Let us ride to Camelot!

244
00:21:38,238 --> 00:21:41,496
We're knights of the Round Table
We dance when e're we're able

245
00:21:41,536 --> 00:21:44,794
We do routines and chorus scenes
with footwork impeccable

246
00:21:44,833 --> 00:21:47,899
We dine well here in Camelot
We eat ham and jam and Spam a lot

247
00:21:54,456 --> 00:21:57,868
We're knights of the Round Table
Our shows are formidable

248
00:21:59,479 --> 00:22:02,162
But many times we're given rhymes
that are quite unsingable

249
00:22:02,239 --> 00:22:07,260
We're opera mad in Camelot
We sing from the diaphragm a lot

250
00:22:20,490 --> 00:22:23,211
In war we're tough and able

251
00:22:23,288 --> 00:22:25,587
Quite indefatigable

252
00:22:26,663 --> 00:22:29,499
Between our quests we sequin vests
and impersonate Clark Gable

253
00:22:29,577 --> 00:22:31,071
It's a busy life in Camelot

254
00:22:31,149 --> 00:22:35,902
I have to push the pram a lot

255
00:22:39,814 --> 00:22:42,267
On second thought,
let's not go to Camelot.

256
00:22:42,344 --> 00:22:44,490
- It is a silly place.
- Right.

257
00:22:53,501 --> 00:22:56,682
Arthur! Arthur!

258
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:58,715
King of the Britons!

259
00:23:00,748 --> 00:23:03,968
Don't grovel. If there's one thing
I can't stand, it's people groveling.

260
00:23:04,045 --> 00:23:05,885
- Sorry.
- And don't apologize!

261
00:23:05,962 --> 00:23:09,143
Every time I taIk to someone, it's
"Sorry this" and "forgive me that"...

262
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:11,060
and "I'm not worthy."

263
00:23:11,138 --> 00:23:13,974
- What are you doing now?
- Averting my eyes.

264
00:23:14,052 --> 00:23:18,499
Don't! It's like those miserable psalms.
They're so depressing.

265
00:23:18,538 --> 00:23:20,914
- Now knock it off!
- Yes, Lord!

266
00:23:20,992 --> 00:23:24,250
Arthur, king of the Britons...

267
00:23:24,328 --> 00:23:26,666
your Knights of the Round Table
shall have a task...

268
00:23:26,742 --> 00:23:29,386
to make them an example
in these dark times.

269
00:23:29,465 --> 00:23:30,844
Good idea.

270
00:23:30,884 --> 00:23:32,800
Of course it's a good idea!

271
00:23:32,877 --> 00:23:36,365
Behold, Arthur,
this is the Holy Grail.

272
00:23:36,443 --> 00:23:38,781
Look well, Arthur...

273
00:23:38,819 --> 00:23:41,387
for it is your sacred task
to seek this Grail.

274
00:23:41,465 --> 00:23:44,492
That is your purpose, Arthur.

275
00:23:44,571 --> 00:23:47,484
The quest for the Holy Grail.

276
00:23:51,089 --> 00:23:53,427
A blessing from the Lord!

277
00:23:53,466 --> 00:23:54,999
God be praised!

278
00:24:50,402 --> 00:24:51,628
Halt!

279
00:25:01,982 --> 00:25:03,438
Hello!

280
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:12,143
HelIo!

281
00:25:13,449 --> 00:25:15,329
Hello? Who is it?

282
00:25:15,407 --> 00:25:18,516
It is King Arthur, and these are
my Knights of the Round Table.

283
00:25:18,593 --> 00:25:20,435
Whose castle is this?

284
00:25:20,513 --> 00:25:23,852
This is the castle of my master,
Guy di Loimbard.

285
00:25:23,930 --> 00:25:25,925
Go and tell your master...

286
00:25:26,003 --> 00:25:29,687
that we have been charged by God
with a sacred quest.

287
00:25:29,727 --> 00:25:32,759
If he will give us tood and shelter
for the night...

288
00:25:32,837 --> 00:25:35,831
he can join us in our quest
for the Holy Grail.

289
00:25:35,908 --> 00:25:38,978
I'll ask him, but I don't think
he'll be very keen.

290
00:25:39,056 --> 00:25:41,244
He's already got one, you see.

291
00:25:42,128 --> 00:25:45,775
- What?
- He says they've already got one.

292
00:25:45,852 --> 00:25:47,809
Are you sure he's got one?

293
00:25:47,887 --> 00:25:49,882
Yes. It's very nice.

294
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:53,644
I told him we already got one.

295
00:25:53,684 --> 00:25:56,985
Well, can we come up
and have a look?

296
00:25:57,063 --> 00:25:59,826
Of course not!
You are English types.

297
00:26:00,978 --> 00:26:02,359
What are you?

298
00:26:02,399 --> 00:26:07,389
I'm French ! Why do you think I have
this outrageous accent, you silly king?

299
00:26:07,467 --> 00:26:10,499
- What are you doing in England?
- Mind your own business!

300
00:26:12,035 --> 00:26:16,142
If you will not show us the Grail,
we shall take your castle by force.

301
00:26:16,220 --> 00:26:19,636
You don't frighten us,
English pig-dogs!

302
00:26:19,714 --> 00:26:23,783
Go and boil your bottoms,
sons of a silly person!

303
00:26:23,860 --> 00:26:27,660
I blow my nose at you,
so-called Arthur King!

304
00:26:27,738 --> 00:26:30,118
You and all your silly English...

305
00:26:30,157 --> 00:26:32,037
"kniggits."

306
00:26:38,296 --> 00:26:41,712
- What a strange person.
- Look here, my good man--

307
00:26:41,789 --> 00:26:43,823
I don't want to talk to you no more...

308
00:26:43,862 --> 00:26:47,163
you empty-headed animal
food-trough wiper!

309
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:50,657
I fart in your general direction.

310
00:26:50,734 --> 00:26:52,691
Your mother was a hamster...

311
00:26:52,770 --> 00:26:56,800
and your father smelt of elderberries!

312
00:26:57,684 --> 00:27:00,179
Is there someone else we could talk to?

313
00:27:00,256 --> 00:27:04,862
No. Now go away,
or I shall taunt you a second time.

314
00:27:06,322 --> 00:27:09,469
This is your last chance.
I've been more than reasonabIe.

315
00:27:15,038 --> 00:27:18,454
If you do not agree to my commands,
then I shall--

316
00:27:19,913 --> 00:27:21,102
Jesus Christ!

317
00:27:25,403 --> 00:27:27,283
Right!

318
00:27:27,362 --> 00:27:29,204
Charge!

319
00:27:35,308 --> 00:27:37,188
This one is for your mother!

320
00:27:42,181 --> 00:27:43,869
Run away!

321
00:27:54,275 --> 00:27:56,884
Filthy fiends.
I'll tear them apart.

322
00:27:56,962 --> 00:28:00,416
Sir, I have a plan.

323
00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:34,440
- What?
- A present.

324
00:29:34,517 --> 00:29:36,474
Hurry. Let's go.

325
00:29:59,050 --> 00:30:00,889
What happens now?

326
00:30:00,966 --> 00:30:04,031
Now Lancelot, Galahad and I...

327
00:30:04,110 --> 00:30:07,521
wait until nightfall,
and then leap out of the rabbit...

328
00:30:07,598 --> 00:30:09,896
taking the French by surprise.

329
00:30:09,974 --> 00:30:13,385
Not only by surprise,
but totally unarmed.

330
00:30:13,463 --> 00:30:15,532
Who leaps out?

331
00:30:15,609 --> 00:30:18,522
Lancelot, Galahad and I...

332
00:30:18,599 --> 00:30:21,856
leap out of the rabbit and--

333
00:30:26,419 --> 00:30:29,676
Look, if we built
this large, wooden badger--

334
00:30:32,820 --> 00:30:34,352
Run away!

335
00:30:44,818 --> 00:30:47,768
- Feature for schools. Take eight.
- Action.

336
00:30:47,846 --> 00:30:51,678
Defeat at the castle seems to
have utterly disheartened King Arthur.

337
00:30:51,756 --> 00:30:56,393
The ferocity of the French taunting
took him completely by surprise.

338
00:30:56,471 --> 00:31:00,648
And Arthur became convinced
that a new strategy was required...

339
00:31:00,726 --> 00:31:04,865
if the quest for the Holy Grail were to
be brought to a successful concIusion.

340
00:31:04,943 --> 00:31:08,085
Arthur, having consulted
his cIosest knights...

341
00:31:08,162 --> 00:31:12,531
decided that they should separate
and search for the Grail individually.

342
00:31:12,571 --> 00:31:15,215
Now this is what they did.

343
00:31:17,515 --> 00:31:18,894
Frank!

344
00:31:26,408 --> 00:31:29,128
"The Tale of Sir Robin. "

345
00:31:29,168 --> 00:31:32,616
So each of the knights
went their separate ways.

346
00:31:32,695 --> 00:31:36,106
Sir Robin rode north
through the dark forest of Ewing...

347
00:31:36,183 --> 00:31:38,520
accompanied by his favorite minstrel.

348
00:31:39,748 --> 00:31:43,848
Bravely, bold Sir Robin
rode north from Camelot

349
00:31:43,926 --> 00:31:48,180
He was not afraid to die
O brave Sir Robin

350
00:31:48,257 --> 00:31:52,281
He was not at all afraid
to be killed in nasty ways

351
00:31:52,321 --> 00:31:54,773
Brave, brave, brave Sir Robin

352
00:31:56,768 --> 00:32:00,831
He was not in the least bit scared
to be mashed into a pulp

353
00:32:00,907 --> 00:32:05,161
Or to have his eyes gouged out
and his elbows broken

354
00:32:05,238 --> 00:32:09,223
To have his kneecaps split
and his body burned away

355
00:32:09,302 --> 00:32:12,750
And his limbs all hacked and mangled
Brave Sir Robin

356
00:32:13,786 --> 00:32:17,656
His head smashed in, his heart cut out
His liver removed, his bowels unplugged

357
00:32:17,735 --> 00:32:20,839
His nostrils raped, his bottom burnt off
And his penis--

358
00:32:20,917 --> 00:32:23,867
That's enough music for now, lads.

359
00:32:23,945 --> 00:32:26,282
Looks like there's dirty work afoot.

360
00:32:28,352 --> 00:32:31,648
Anarcho-syndicalist
is a way of preserving freedom.

361
00:32:31,726 --> 00:32:34,791
Oh, Dennis, torget about freedom!
And don't drop that mud.

362
00:32:38,396 --> 00:32:40,694
Halt! Who art thou?

363
00:32:40,734 --> 00:32:43,723
He is brave Sir Robin
Brave Sir Robin who--

364
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:46,750
Shut up!
Nobody really.

365
00:32:46,829 --> 00:32:49,971
- I'm just passing through.
- What do you want?

366
00:32:50,049 --> 00:32:52,041
To fight and--

367
00:32:52,118 --> 00:32:53,766
Shut up!

368
00:32:53,844 --> 00:32:55,300
Nothing really.

369
00:32:55,377 --> 00:32:58,251
Just to pass through,
good Sir Knight.

370
00:32:58,329 --> 00:32:59,746
I'm afraid not.

371
00:33:01,510 --> 00:33:03,847
Actually I am
a Knight of the Round Table.

372
00:33:03,925 --> 00:33:07,336
- You're a Knight of the Round TabIe?
- I am.

373
00:33:07,414 --> 00:33:09,866
- In that case I shall have to kiIl you.
- Shall I?

374
00:33:09,943 --> 00:33:12,012
- I don't think so.
- What do I think?

375
00:33:12,090 --> 00:33:13,929
- Kill him.
- Let's be nice to him.

376
00:33:14,006 --> 00:33:15,883
Shut up! And you !

377
00:33:15,962 --> 00:33:18,069
Get the sword out.
I want to cut his head off!

378
00:33:18,147 --> 00:33:21,289
- Cut your own head off.
- Do us all a favor.

379
00:33:21,366 --> 00:33:24,508
- Yapping on all the time.
- You're lucky you're not next to him.

380
00:33:24,586 --> 00:33:26,847
- What do you mean?
- You snore.

381
00:33:26,924 --> 00:33:29,261
I don't. Anyway,
you've got bad breath.

382
00:33:29,301 --> 00:33:33,401
- Because you don't brush my teeth.
- Stop bitching. Let's have tea.

383
00:33:33,478 --> 00:33:37,770
All right. We'll kill him first,
then have tea and biscuits.

384
00:33:37,849 --> 00:33:40,416
- Not biscuits.
- AIl right, not biscuits.

385
00:33:40,456 --> 00:33:42,602
- Let's kill him anyway.
- Right.

386
00:33:45,592 --> 00:33:47,738
- He's buggered off.
- So he has. He's scarpered!

387
00:33:47,815 --> 00:33:50,113
Brave Sir Robin ran away

388
00:33:50,192 --> 00:33:52,261
Bravely ran away, away

389
00:33:52,339 --> 00:33:53,948
I didn't!

390
00:33:54,025 --> 00:33:58,010
When danger reared its ugly head
he bravely turned his tail and fled

391
00:33:58,088 --> 00:34:00,234
- Brave Sir Robin turned about
- I didn't!

392
00:34:00,311 --> 00:34:03,146
And gallantly he chickened out
Bravely taking to his feet

393
00:34:03,225 --> 00:34:05,523
- I never did!
- He beat a very brave retreat

394
00:34:05,601 --> 00:34:07,899
- All lies!
- Bravest of the brave, Sir Robin

395
00:34:07,977 --> 00:34:09,356
I never!

396
00:34:38,260 --> 00:34:41,517
"The Tale of Sir Galahad. "

397
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:34,812
Open the door!

398
00:35:37,343 --> 00:35:40,877
In the name of King Arthur,
open the door!

399
00:35:50,347 --> 00:35:51,743
Hello.

400
00:35:51,830 --> 00:35:54,753
Welcome, gentle Sir Knight.

401
00:35:54,841 --> 00:35:56,935
Welcome to the Castle Anthrax.

402
00:35:57,808 --> 00:35:59,553
Castle Anthrax?

403
00:35:59,641 --> 00:36:03,873
Yes. It's not a very good name,
is it?

404
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:09,195
But we are nice, and we will attend
to your every need.

405
00:36:09,284 --> 00:36:12,163
You are the keepers
of the Holy Grail?

406
00:36:12,208 --> 00:36:15,393
- The what?
- The Grail. It is here?

407
00:36:16,396 --> 00:36:20,104
But you are tired,
and you must rest a while.

408
00:36:20,149 --> 00:36:23,246
- Midget. Crapper.
- Yes, O Zoot?

409
00:36:23,335 --> 00:36:25,298
Prepare a bed for our guest.

410
00:36:25,385 --> 00:36:28,875
Thank you. Thank you.

411
00:36:28,963 --> 00:36:31,668
Away, away, varletesses.

412
00:36:31,756 --> 00:36:37,384
The beds here are warm and soft
and very, very big.

413
00:36:38,651 --> 00:36:41,007
What is your name, handsome knight?

414
00:36:41,094 --> 00:36:44,497
Sir Galahad the Chaste.

415
00:36:44,585 --> 00:36:48,642
Mine is Zoot. Just Zoot.

416
00:36:48,730 --> 00:36:51,260
- But come.
- No, please!

417
00:36:51,304 --> 00:36:53,834
In God's name, show me the Grail.

418
00:36:53,922 --> 00:36:57,761
You have suffered much.
You are delirious.

419
00:36:57,850 --> 00:37:00,729
I have seen it. It is here.

420
00:37:00,817 --> 00:37:06,052
You would not be so ungallant
as to refuse our hospitality.

421
00:37:07,405 --> 00:37:10,939
I'm afraid our life must seem...

422
00:37:11,027 --> 00:37:15,041
very duIl and quiet
compared to yours.

423
00:37:15,129 --> 00:37:18,226
We are but eightscore
young blondes and brunettes...

424
00:37:18,271 --> 00:37:21,063
all between 16 and 19-and-a-half...

425
00:37:21,150 --> 00:37:24,553
cut off in this castle
with no one to protect us.

426
00:37:24,641 --> 00:37:27,869
Oh, it is a lonely Iife.

427
00:37:27,957 --> 00:37:31,883
Bathing, dressing, undressing...

428
00:37:31,972 --> 00:37:34,109
making exciting underwear.

429
00:37:35,899 --> 00:37:38,429
We are not used to handsome knights.

430
00:37:38,473 --> 00:37:41,570
Nay, come, come.
You may lie here.

431
00:37:42,662 --> 00:37:46,632
- Oh, but you are wounded!
- No, it's nothing.

432
00:37:46,721 --> 00:37:49,382
You must see the doctors immediately.

433
00:37:49,470 --> 00:37:52,087
No, please, lie down.

434
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:57,716
What seems to be the trouble?

435
00:37:57,803 --> 00:38:00,595
They're doctors?

436
00:38:00,639 --> 00:38:03,475
They have basic medical training, yes.

437
00:38:03,564 --> 00:38:07,054
Come, come.
You must try to rest.

438
00:38:07,142 --> 00:38:11,679
Dr. Piglet, Dr. Winston,
practice your art.

439
00:38:18,181 --> 00:38:21,933
- Try to relax.
- Are you sure that's necessary?

440
00:38:22,021 --> 00:38:24,158
We must examine you.

441
00:38:27,301 --> 00:38:31,576
- There's nothing wrong with that.
- Please. We are doctors.

442
00:38:33,366 --> 00:38:35,809
No! This cannot be.

443
00:38:35,896 --> 00:38:38,426
- I am sworn to chastity.
- Back to your bed at once.

444
00:38:38,515 --> 00:38:42,049
Torment me no longer.
I have seen the Grail.

445
00:38:42,137 --> 00:38:45,191
- There's no grail here.
- I have seen it!

446
00:38:46,456 --> 00:38:49,248
- I have seen--
- Hello.

447
00:39:18,004 --> 00:39:21,581
No. I am Zoot's
identical twin sister Dingo.

448
00:39:21,626 --> 00:39:23,894
- Excuse me.
- Where are you going?

449
00:39:23,982 --> 00:39:27,734
I seek the Grail.
I have seen it here in this castle!

450
00:39:29,131 --> 00:39:32,447
No! Oh, no!

451
00:39:32,535 --> 00:39:35,676
- Bad, bad Zoot!
- What is it?

452
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:38,468
Wicked, bad, naughty Zoot!

453
00:39:38,556 --> 00:39:43,573
She has been lighting our beacon, which
I've just remembered is grail-shaped.

454
00:39:43,661 --> 00:39:48,286
- This is not the first time.
- It's not the real Grail?

455
00:39:48,374 --> 00:39:52,431
Wicked, bad, naughty, evil Zoot!

456
00:39:52,519 --> 00:39:56,271
She is a naughty person,
and she must pay the penalty.

457
00:39:56,359 --> 00:40:02,205
Here in Anthrax we have one punishment
for lighting the grail-shaped beacon.

458
00:40:02,250 --> 00:40:05,356
You must tie her down on a bed
and spank her.

459
00:40:05,433 --> 00:40:07,349
A spanking!

460
00:40:07,428 --> 00:40:11,262
Spank her well, and atter you have
spanked her, deal with her as you like.

461
00:40:11,339 --> 00:40:14,713
- Then spank me.
- And me.

462
00:40:14,791 --> 00:40:17,743
Yes. Give us all a good spanking.

463
00:40:20,467 --> 00:40:23,764
And atter the spanking,
the oral sex.

464
00:40:26,449 --> 00:40:28,519
I could stay a bit longer.

465
00:40:28,598 --> 00:40:30,668
- Sir Galahad!
- HelIo.

466
00:40:30,745 --> 00:40:32,931
Quick! Quick!
You're in great peril!

467
00:40:33,007 --> 00:40:35,384
- No, he isn't!
- Silence, foul temptress!

468
00:40:35,424 --> 00:40:37,724
- She's got the point.
- We will cover your escape.

469
00:40:37,801 --> 00:40:39,180
I'm fine!

470
00:40:40,716 --> 00:40:44,013
- I can tackle this lot single-handed.
- Let him tackle us singled-handed.

471
00:40:45,434 --> 00:40:49,038
- No, Sir Galahad. Come.
- I can handle this lot easily.

472
00:40:49,116 --> 00:40:51,302
Let him handle us easiIy.

473
00:40:51,378 --> 00:40:54,637
Wait. I can defeat them.
There's only 150 of them.

474
00:40:54,715 --> 00:40:58,472
Yes! He'Il beat us easily!
We haven't a chance.

475
00:41:02,232 --> 00:41:03,574
Oh, shit!

476
00:41:03,650 --> 00:41:06,487
- You were in great peril.
- I don't think I was.

477
00:41:06,527 --> 00:41:09,748
- You were in terrible peril.
- Let me go back in and face the peril.

478
00:41:09,825 --> 00:41:13,390
- It's too perilous.
- My duty is to sample peril.

479
00:41:13,431 --> 00:41:16,422
- We've got to find the Holy Grail.
- Let me have a bit of peril.

480
00:41:16,498 --> 00:41:19,182
- No. It's unhealthy.
- I bet you're gay.

481
00:41:19,221 --> 00:41:20,754
I am not.

482
00:41:20,833 --> 00:41:25,127
"'Sir Lancelot had saved Sir Galahad
from almost certain temptation. "

483
00:41:25,205 --> 00:41:27,659
But they were no nearer the Grail.

484
00:41:27,697 --> 00:41:29,575
Meanwhile,
King Arthur and Sir Bedevere...

485
00:41:29,653 --> 00:41:32,681
not more than a swallow's flight away
had discovered something.

486
00:41:34,447 --> 00:41:36,862
That's an unladen swallow's flight,
obviously.

487
00:41:36,940 --> 00:41:39,317
They were more than two laden
swallows' flights away.

488
00:41:39,395 --> 00:41:43,267
four if they had a coconut on a line
between them. If the birds walked--

489
00:41:43,345 --> 00:41:45,492
Get on with it!

490
00:41:45,569 --> 00:41:49,097
Anyway, on to scene 24,
a smashing scene with lovely acting...

491
00:41:49,174 --> 00:41:51,436
in which Arthur discovers
a vital clue...

492
00:41:51,475 --> 00:41:54,657
in which there are no swallows,
although I think--

493
00:41:56,537 --> 00:42:00,294
And this enchanter of whom you speak,
he has seen the Grail?

494
00:42:05,128 --> 00:42:08,541
Where does he live?
Old man, where does he live?

495
00:42:09,538 --> 00:42:11,608
He knows of a cave.

496
00:42:11,686 --> 00:42:14,292
A cave which no man has entered.

497
00:42:14,371 --> 00:42:16,748
And the Grail is there?

498
00:42:16,826 --> 00:42:19,969
There is much danger,
for beyond the cave...

499
00:42:20,047 --> 00:42:22,807
lies the Gorge of Eternal Peril...

500
00:42:22,884 --> 00:42:25,798
which no man has ever crossed.

501
00:42:25,877 --> 00:42:28,254
But the Grail !
Where is the Grail?

502
00:42:28,331 --> 00:42:31,896
Seek you the Bridge of Death!

503
00:42:33,316 --> 00:42:35,386
The Bridge of Death
which leads to the Grail?

504
00:43:18,993 --> 00:43:20,603
Who are you?

505
00:43:20,681 --> 00:43:25,359
- We are the Knights Who Say "Ni."
- No, not the Knights Who Say "Ni."

506
00:43:25,436 --> 00:43:27,429
- The same.
- Who are thee?

507
00:43:27,508 --> 00:43:30,805
We are the keepers of the sacred words:

508
00:43:30,882 --> 00:43:34,410
"Ni," "Peng," and "Nee-wom"!

509
00:43:35,293 --> 00:43:37,286
Those who hear them seldom live.

510
00:43:37,364 --> 00:43:41,736
The Knights Who Say "Ni"
demand a sacrifice.

511
00:43:41,774 --> 00:43:46,107
We are simple travelers who seek the
enchanter who lives beyond these woods.

512
00:43:52,972 --> 00:43:56,385
We shall say "Ni" again to you...

513
00:43:56,463 --> 00:43:58,341
if you do not appease us.

514
00:43:58,380 --> 00:44:01,217
- What do you want?
- We want...

515
00:44:02,407 --> 00:44:03,749
a shrubbery!

516
00:44:05,361 --> 00:44:06,740
A what?

517
00:44:09,196 --> 00:44:11,534
Please, no more!
We will find you a shrubbery.

518
00:44:11,612 --> 00:44:14,027
You must return here with a shrubbery...

519
00:44:14,105 --> 00:44:19,704
or else you wilI never pass
through this wood alive.

520
00:44:19,780 --> 00:44:23,154
You are just and fair,
and we will return with the shrubbery.

521
00:44:23,232 --> 00:44:25,187
- One that looks nice.
- Of course.

522
00:44:25,265 --> 00:44:27,105
- And not too expensive.
- Yes.

523
00:44:27,182 --> 00:44:30,249
Now go!

524
00:45:11,823 --> 00:45:13,318
Stop that. Stop that.

525
00:45:14,585 --> 00:45:17,269
Go on, clear off. Go away.

526
00:45:17,346 --> 00:45:19,800
Do it. Go away.

527
00:45:19,877 --> 00:45:21,832
And you, clear off!

528
00:45:26,090 --> 00:45:27,508
Bloody weather.

529
00:45:27,547 --> 00:45:31,112
"The Tale of Sir Lancelot. "

530
00:45:36,215 --> 00:45:39,321
One day, lad,
all this will be yours.

531
00:45:39,399 --> 00:45:41,853
- The curtains?
- Not the curtains, lad.

532
00:45:41,929 --> 00:45:46,185
All you can see stretched
over the hills and valleys of this land.

533
00:45:46,263 --> 00:45:48,371
- This wiIl be your kingdom.
- But, Mother--

534
00:45:48,449 --> 00:45:49,828
I'm Father.

535
00:45:49,868 --> 00:45:52,322
But, Father, I don't want any of that.

536
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:55,813
Listen, I built this kingdom
up from nothing.

537
00:45:55,852 --> 00:45:58,689
When I started,
all there was was swamp.

538
00:45:58,768 --> 00:46:01,529
All the kings said I was datt
to build a castle in a swamp...

539
00:46:01,606 --> 00:46:04,942
but I built it all the same,
just to show 'em.

540
00:46:05,020 --> 00:46:08,356
It sank into the swamp.
So I built a second one.

541
00:46:08,434 --> 00:46:11,003
That sank into the swamp.
So I built a third one.

542
00:46:11,082 --> 00:46:13,075
That burned down, fell over,
then sank into the swamp!

543
00:46:13,153 --> 00:46:16,221
But the fourth one stayed up!

544
00:46:16,299 --> 00:46:18,216
And that's what you're gonna get.

545
00:46:18,294 --> 00:46:21,438
The strongest castle in these isles.

546
00:46:21,516 --> 00:46:24,967
- I don't want any of that. I'd rather--
- Rather what?

547
00:46:25,006 --> 00:46:29,225
I'd rather just sing!

548
00:46:30,338 --> 00:46:32,984
Stop that! You're not going
into a song while I'm here.

549
00:46:33,062 --> 00:46:36,130
Listen. In 20 minutes
you're getting married to a girl...

550
00:46:36,208 --> 00:46:40,043
whose father owns the biggest tracts
of open land in Britain.

551
00:46:40,120 --> 00:46:42,037
But I don't want land.

552
00:46:42,115 --> 00:46:44,454
- Listen, Alice--
- Herbert.

553
00:46:44,494 --> 00:46:47,945
We live in a bloody swamp.
We need all the land we can get!

554
00:46:48,023 --> 00:46:50,094
But I don't like her.

555
00:46:50,171 --> 00:46:53,200
Don't like her?
What's wrong with her?

556
00:46:53,278 --> 00:46:55,847
She's beautiful. She's rich.

557
00:46:55,887 --> 00:46:57,843
She's got huge...

558
00:46:57,921 --> 00:47:00,145
tracts of land.

559
00:47:00,222 --> 00:47:01,602
I know...

560
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:05,899
but I want the girl
that I marry to have...

561
00:47:05,938 --> 00:47:10,157
a certain special something.

562
00:47:10,235 --> 00:47:12,075
Cut that out!

563
00:47:13,035 --> 00:47:15,720
Look, you're marrying
Princess Lucky...

564
00:47:15,759 --> 00:47:18,788
so you better get used to the idea.

565
00:47:18,866 --> 00:47:20,015
Guards!

566
00:47:21,052 --> 00:47:23,852
Make sure the prince doesn't leave
this room until I come and get him.

567
00:47:23,891 --> 00:47:26,728
Not to leave the room,
even if you come and get him.

568
00:47:26,768 --> 00:47:29,031
No, no. Until I come and get him.

569
00:47:29,108 --> 00:47:32,215
Until you come and get him,
we're not to enter the room.

570
00:47:32,292 --> 00:47:37,163
No, no. You stay in the room
and make sure he doesn't leave.

571
00:47:37,241 --> 00:47:39,465
- And you'll come and get him.
- Right.

572
00:47:39,542 --> 00:47:43,415
We don't need to do anything apart
from just stop him entering the room.

573
00:47:43,494 --> 00:47:46,677
- No, no. Leaving the room.
- Leaving the room. Yes.

574
00:47:46,754 --> 00:47:48,556
All right?

575
00:47:50,475 --> 00:47:52,929
- Yes? What is it?
- If-- Oh.

576
00:47:53,007 --> 00:47:54,885
It's quite simple.

577
00:47:54,925 --> 00:47:59,796
You just stay here and make sure
he doesn't leave the room.

578
00:47:59,874 --> 00:48:01,254
All right?

579
00:48:01,293 --> 00:48:04,937
Oh, I remember.
Can he leave the room with us?

580
00:48:05,014 --> 00:48:08,504
No, no. You just keep him in here,
and make sure--

581
00:48:08,582 --> 00:48:10,422
Oh, yes! We'll keep him
in here, obviously.

582
00:48:10,500 --> 00:48:12,647
But if he had to leave
and we were with him--

583
00:48:12,724 --> 00:48:15,409
- Just keep him in here--
- Until you or anyone eIse--

584
00:48:15,487 --> 00:48:17,865
- No, not anyone else, just me.
- Just you.

585
00:48:17,941 --> 00:48:19,398
- Get back.
- Get back.

586
00:48:19,477 --> 00:48:22,238
- Right?
- We'lI stay here until you get back.

587
00:48:22,314 --> 00:48:24,154
And make sure he doesn't leave.

588
00:48:24,233 --> 00:48:25,843
What?

589
00:48:25,921 --> 00:48:27,914
Make sure he doesn't leave.

590
00:48:27,992 --> 00:48:31,099
- The prince?
- Yes, make sure he doesn't leave--

591
00:48:31,176 --> 00:48:34,320
Oh, yes, of course.
I thought you meant him.

592
00:48:34,398 --> 00:48:38,233
It seemed a bit datt, me having
to guard him when he's a guard.

593
00:48:38,311 --> 00:48:41,072
- Is that clear?
- Oh, quite clear. No probIems.

594
00:48:41,150 --> 00:48:42,530
Right.

595
00:48:44,296 --> 00:48:46,789
- Where are you going?
- We're coming with you.

596
00:48:46,866 --> 00:48:51,200
No, no. I want you to stay here
and make sure he doesn't leave.

597
00:48:51,278 --> 00:48:52,965
Oh, I see. Right.

598
00:48:54,155 --> 00:48:57,799
Shut your noise, you!
And get that suit on !

599
00:49:03,821 --> 00:49:06,275
And no singing!

600
00:49:06,353 --> 00:49:08,539
Go get a glass of water.

601
00:49:55,111 --> 00:49:57,604
- Well taken, Concord.
- Thank you, sir. Most kind.

602
00:49:57,642 --> 00:49:59,329
And again.

603
00:49:59,407 --> 00:50:02,973
Over we go! Good. Steady.

604
00:50:03,051 --> 00:50:05,237
And now, the big one!

605
00:50:05,315 --> 00:50:07,961
Come on, Concord.

606
00:50:08,039 --> 00:50:10,148
Message for you, sir.

607
00:50:11,759 --> 00:50:14,520
Concord, speak to me!

608
00:50:23,651 --> 00:50:25,568
"To whoever finds this note:

609
00:50:25,646 --> 00:50:29,865
I have been imprisoned by my father...

610
00:50:29,943 --> 00:50:32,321
who wishes me to marry
against my will.

611
00:50:32,398 --> 00:50:35,389
Please, please,
please come and rescue me.

612
00:50:35,467 --> 00:50:38,880
I am in the tall tower
of Swamp Castle."

613
00:50:38,957 --> 00:50:41,794
At last! A call!
A cry of distress!

614
00:50:41,834 --> 00:50:45,170
This could be the sign that leads us
to the Holy Grail.

615
00:50:45,249 --> 00:50:49,315
Brave, brave Concord,
you shall not have died in vain.

616
00:50:49,392 --> 00:50:51,309
I'm not quite dead, sir.

617
00:50:53,612 --> 00:50:56,105
WeIl, you shall not have been
mortally wounded in vain.

618
00:50:56,182 --> 00:50:58,982
I think I could pull through, sir.

619
00:50:59,021 --> 00:51:00,401
Oh, I see.

620
00:51:00,478 --> 00:51:03,776
-I think I'm all right to come with you.
-No, no, stay here.

621
00:51:03,816 --> 00:51:07,536
I will send help when I have made
the daring and heroic rescue...

622
00:51:07,613 --> 00:51:09,760
in my own particular--

623
00:51:12,562 --> 00:51:14,440
- Idiom, sir?
- Idiom!

624
00:51:14,479 --> 00:51:18,621
- No, I feel fine, actually, sir.
- Farewell, sweet Concord.

625
00:51:18,700 --> 00:51:22,614
I'll just stay here, then,
shall I, sir?

626
00:51:23,651 --> 00:51:25,031
Yeah.

627
00:52:02,297 --> 00:52:04,023
- Morning.
- Morning.

628
00:53:36,745 --> 00:53:39,546
You're not allowed
to enter this room--

629
00:53:41,273 --> 00:53:44,150
O fair one, behold your humble servant,
Sir Lancelot of Camelot.

630
00:53:44,229 --> 00:53:46,186
I have come to take--
Oh, I'm terribly sorry.

631
00:53:46,263 --> 00:53:49,754
- You got my note!
- WeIl, I got a note.

632
00:53:49,832 --> 00:53:53,247
- You've come to rescue me.
- You see--

633
00:53:53,324 --> 00:53:55,165
I knew someone would.

634
00:53:55,244 --> 00:54:00,309
I knew that somewhere out there,
there must be someone who--

635
00:54:00,386 --> 00:54:02,841
Stop that! Stop it!

636
00:54:03,725 --> 00:54:05,604
- Who are you?
- I'm your son!

637
00:54:05,682 --> 00:54:07,907
- Not you.
- I am Sir Lancelot, sir.

638
00:54:07,984 --> 00:54:11,053
- He's come to rescue me, Father.
- Let's not jump to conclusions.

639
00:54:11,094 --> 00:54:13,933
Did you kill all those guards?

640
00:54:13,972 --> 00:54:15,851
Oh, yes. Sorry.

641
00:54:15,891 --> 00:54:18,960
- They cost 50 pounds each!
- I'm sorry. I can explain.

642
00:54:18,999 --> 00:54:22,797
Don't be afraid of him.
I've got a rope all ready.

643
00:54:22,837 --> 00:54:25,292
You killed eight wedding guests in aIl !

644
00:54:25,370 --> 00:54:28,554
-You see, I thought your son was a lady.
-I can understand that.

645
00:54:28,633 --> 00:54:30,627
Hurry, Sir Lancelot.

646
00:54:30,705 --> 00:54:34,734
- You only killed the bride's father.
- I didn't mean to.

647
00:54:34,811 --> 00:54:38,801
- You put your sword through his head!
- Oh, dear. Is he all right?

648
00:54:38,879 --> 00:54:41,565
You even kicked the bride.
This is gonna cost me a tortune.

649
00:54:41,604 --> 00:54:45,441
I can explain. I was riding north
from Camelot when I got this note--

650
00:54:45,519 --> 00:54:48,089
Camelot?
Are you from Camelot?

651
00:54:48,166 --> 00:54:49,700
Hurry.

652
00:54:49,779 --> 00:54:52,656
- I am a knight of King Arthur.
- Very nice castle, Camelot.

653
00:54:52,733 --> 00:54:55,687
- Very good pig country.
- Is it?

654
00:54:55,765 --> 00:54:57,722
Hurry. I am ready.

655
00:54:57,800 --> 00:55:01,093
- Would you like to come have a drink?
- That's awfully nice of you.

656
00:55:01,170 --> 00:55:03,008
I am ready!

657
00:55:03,085 --> 00:55:05,497
I mean, to be so understanding.

658
00:55:05,574 --> 00:55:08,407
I'm afraid when I'm in this idiom,
I get carried away.

659
00:55:08,485 --> 00:55:10,323
Don't worry about that.

660
00:55:15,341 --> 00:55:18,595
This is the main hall. We're having this
made into one big living room.

661
00:55:18,673 --> 00:55:21,812
- There he is!
- Oh, bloody hell.

662
00:55:24,151 --> 00:55:25,337
Hold it!

663
00:55:31,466 --> 00:55:33,227
- Please.
- Sorry, sorry.

664
00:55:33,304 --> 00:55:37,592
See what I mean? I get carried away.
I really must apologize. Sorry.

665
00:55:37,671 --> 00:55:40,504
He's killed the best man !

666
00:55:40,581 --> 00:55:42,993
Hold it. Hold it, please.

667
00:55:43,071 --> 00:55:47,207
This is Sir Lancelot
from the court of Camelot.

668
00:55:47,284 --> 00:55:50,347
A very brave and influential knight...

669
00:55:50,387 --> 00:55:52,570
and my speciaI guest here today.

670
00:55:52,646 --> 00:55:54,560
- Hello.
- He killed my auntie!

671
00:55:55,404 --> 00:55:57,012
Please, please!

672
00:55:57,090 --> 00:56:00,000
This is supposed to be
a happy occasion.

673
00:56:00,077 --> 00:56:04,404
Let's not bicker and argue
about who killed who.

674
00:56:04,482 --> 00:56:08,885
We are here today to witness
the union of two young people...

675
00:56:08,962 --> 00:56:11,374
in the joyful bond
of hoIy wedlock.

676
00:56:12,869 --> 00:56:17,042
Untortunately, one of them,
my son Herbert...

677
00:56:17,120 --> 00:56:18,958
has just fallen to his death.

678
00:56:20,300 --> 00:56:22,175
But I don't want to think
I've lost a son...

679
00:56:22,253 --> 00:56:24,971
so much as gained a daughter.

680
00:56:26,044 --> 00:56:30,562
- Since the tragic death of her father--
- He's not quite dead.

681
00:56:32,402 --> 00:56:35,504
Since the near fatal wounding
of her father--

682
00:56:35,582 --> 00:56:38,339
He's getting better.

683
00:56:39,181 --> 00:56:42,359
For, since her own father...

684
00:56:42,399 --> 00:56:45,845
who, when he seemed about to recover...

685
00:56:45,923 --> 00:56:49,522
suddenly felt the icy hand
of death upon him--

686
00:56:49,599 --> 00:56:52,241
Oh, he's died.

687
00:56:52,319 --> 00:56:57,029
I want his only daughter
to look upon me as her own dad...

688
00:56:57,068 --> 00:56:59,940
in a very reaI
and Iegally binding sense.

689
00:57:02,009 --> 00:57:04,612
And I feel sure that the merger--
the union...

690
00:57:04,690 --> 00:57:06,528
between the princess...

691
00:57:06,605 --> 00:57:10,817
and the brave but dangerous
Sir Lancelot of Camelot--

692
00:57:10,895 --> 00:57:12,848
Look! The dead prince!

693
00:57:16,142 --> 00:57:19,588
- He's not quite dead
- No, I feel much better.

694
00:57:19,665 --> 00:57:22,115
You fell out of the tall tower,
you creep!

695
00:57:22,193 --> 00:57:25,907
- No, I was saved at the last minute.
- How?

696
00:57:25,947 --> 00:57:29,240
Well, I'lI tell you.

697
00:57:29,318 --> 00:57:31,462
Not like that! No!

698
00:57:31,539 --> 00:57:33,492
Stop it!

699
00:57:33,569 --> 00:57:36,747
He's going to fell
He's going to fell

700
00:57:39,888 --> 00:57:41,457
Quickly, this way.

701
00:57:41,535 --> 00:57:45,441
No, it's not right for my idiom.
I must escape more--

702
00:57:46,936 --> 00:57:48,046
Dramatically?

703
00:57:48,123 --> 00:57:49,463
Dramatically.

704
00:57:50,269 --> 00:57:51,647
Heave!

705
00:57:53,601 --> 00:57:59,038
What a wonderful escape

706
00:58:01,605 --> 00:58:04,629
Excuse me. Could somebody
give me a push, please?

707
00:58:19,683 --> 00:58:20,869
Old crone.

708
00:58:23,092 --> 00:58:25,849
Is there anywhere in this town
where we could buy a shrubbery?

709
00:58:26,845 --> 00:58:29,487
- Who sent you?
- The Knights Who Say "Ni."

710
00:58:29,565 --> 00:58:32,934
Ah, no. Never.
We've no shrubberies here.

711
00:58:33,012 --> 00:58:35,654
If you do not tell us where
we can buy a shrubbery...

712
00:58:35,731 --> 00:58:39,675
my friend and I will say--

713
00:58:39,752 --> 00:58:41,857
We wilI say "Ni."

714
00:58:42,817 --> 00:58:44,655
Do your worst.

715
00:58:44,731 --> 00:58:48,215
Very well. If you will
not assist us voluntarily--

716
00:58:53,733 --> 00:58:56,222
Never! No shrubbery!

717
00:58:57,332 --> 00:59:00,280
- Nu!
- No, no. It's not that. It's "Ni."

718
00:59:00,358 --> 00:59:03,115
- Nu.
- No. Ni. You're not doing it properIy.

719
00:59:03,193 --> 00:59:05,720
- Ni.
- That's it. You got it.

720
00:59:08,287 --> 00:59:11,197
Are you saying "Ni"
to that old woman?

721
00:59:11,275 --> 00:59:12,844
Um, yes.

722
00:59:12,883 --> 00:59:15,716
Oh, what sad times are these
when passing ruffians...

723
00:59:15,755 --> 00:59:18,588
can say "Ni" at will
to old ladies.

724
00:59:18,667 --> 00:59:22,036
There is a pestilence upon this land.
Nothing is sacred.

725
00:59:22,113 --> 00:59:24,103
Even those who arrange
and design shrubberies...

726
00:59:24,182 --> 00:59:27,513
are under considerable economic stress
at this period in history.

727
00:59:27,591 --> 00:59:30,348
- Did you say shrubberies?
- Yes.

728
00:59:30,425 --> 00:59:33,182
Shrubberies are my trade.
I am a shrubber.

729
00:59:33,259 --> 00:59:35,403
My name is Roger the Shrubber.

730
00:59:35,442 --> 00:59:37,854
I arrange, design
and sell shrubberies.

731
00:59:41,532 --> 00:59:45,361
O Knights of Ni, we have brought you
your shrubbery. May we go now?

732
00:59:45,438 --> 00:59:48,961
It is a good shrubbery.
I like the laurel particularly.

733
00:59:49,039 --> 00:59:51,183
But there is one small problem.

734
00:59:51,222 --> 00:59:52,562
What?

735
00:59:52,639 --> 00:59:56,391
We are now no longer
the Knights Who Say "Ni."

736
00:59:57,657 --> 01:00:03,094
We are now the Knights Who Say
"Ecky, Ecky, Ecky, Pakang, Zoom-ping."

737
01:00:04,168 --> 01:00:05,967
We must give you a test.

738
01:00:06,045 --> 01:00:10,104
What is this test, O Knights of--
Knights Who Till Recently Said "Ni"?

739
01:00:10,181 --> 01:00:14,278
Firstly, you must find
another shrubbery.

740
01:00:15,964 --> 01:00:18,338
Not another shrubbery!

741
01:00:18,416 --> 01:00:22,015
When you have found the shrubbery,
place it beside this shrubbery...

742
01:00:22,055 --> 01:00:25,386
only higher to get the two-level effect
with a path down the middle.

743
01:00:25,463 --> 01:00:26,611
A path!

744
01:00:28,068 --> 01:00:30,901
Then when you have found
the shrubbery...

745
01:00:30,978 --> 01:00:34,884
you must cut down the mightiest tree
in the forest...

746
01:00:34,962 --> 01:00:38,179
with a herring!

747
01:00:39,519 --> 01:00:42,008
- We shall do no such thing.
- Please.

748
01:00:42,085 --> 01:00:45,723
Cut down a tree with a herring?
It can't be done.

749
01:00:45,801 --> 01:00:48,443
- Oh! Don't say that word.
- What word?

750
01:00:48,521 --> 01:00:53,422
I cannot tell. It is one of the words
the Knights of Ni cannot hear.

751
01:00:53,500 --> 01:00:56,151
How can we not say the word
if you don't tell us what it is?

752
01:00:56,229 --> 01:00:58,419
- You said it again!
- What? "Is"?

753
01:00:58,457 --> 01:00:59,840
Not "is."

754
01:00:59,918 --> 01:01:02,108
Wouldn't get far in life
not saying "is."

755
01:01:03,070 --> 01:01:05,030
My Liege, it's Sir Robin!

756
01:01:05,108 --> 01:01:08,105
And packing it up
and sneaking away and buggering off

757
01:01:08,182 --> 01:01:10,103
And chickening out
and pissing off home

758
01:01:10,181 --> 01:01:12,563
Yes, bravely he is
throwing in the sponge

759
01:01:13,525 --> 01:01:16,023
- It's good to see you.
- Now he said the word.

760
01:01:16,100 --> 01:01:18,520
Surely you've not given up your quest
for the Holy Grail.

761
01:01:18,600 --> 01:01:21,367
He is sneaking away
and buggering off

762
01:01:21,443 --> 01:01:23,787
- No, no. Far from it.
- He said the word again.

763
01:01:23,865 --> 01:01:26,093
I was looking for it...

764
01:01:26,172 --> 01:01:29,169
here in this forest.

765
01:01:29,247 --> 01:01:31,168
It is far from this place.

766
01:01:31,246 --> 01:01:35,242
- Stop saying the word!
- Oh, stop it!

767
01:01:35,320 --> 01:01:37,356
- You said it again.
- That's it.

768
01:01:37,434 --> 01:01:40,316
I said it! I said it!
Oh, I said it again!

769
01:01:40,394 --> 01:01:42,892
That's three "its."

770
01:01:48,235 --> 01:01:50,847
And so Arthur and Bedevere
and Sir Robin...

771
01:01:50,926 --> 01:01:53,231
set out on their search
to find the Enchanter...

772
01:01:53,308 --> 01:01:56,920
of whom the old man had spoken
in scene 24.

773
01:01:57,960 --> 01:02:00,572
Beyond the forest,
they met Lancelot and Galahad...

774
01:02:00,650 --> 01:02:02,610
and there was much rejoicing.

775
01:02:14,142 --> 01:02:16,102
In the frozen land of Nador...

776
01:02:16,180 --> 01:02:18,600
they were forced to eat
Robin's minstrel...

777
01:02:19,601 --> 01:02:21,829
and there was much rejoicing.

778
01:02:23,368 --> 01:02:25,212
A year passed.

779
01:02:28,518 --> 01:02:31,285
- Winter changed into spring.
- Nice.

780
01:02:31,362 --> 01:02:33,821
Spring changed into summer.

781
01:02:33,900 --> 01:02:36,359
Summer changed back into winter.

782
01:02:36,437 --> 01:02:39,934
And winter gave spring and summer
a miss and went straight into autumn.

783
01:02:42,356 --> 01:02:43,739
Until one day--

784
01:03:04,842 --> 01:03:06,263
Knights...

785
01:03:07,264 --> 01:03:08,647
Forward.

786
01:03:44,279 --> 01:03:47,430
What manner of man are you that can
summon up fire without flint or tinder?

787
01:03:47,509 --> 01:03:51,082
I am an enchanter.

788
01:03:53,467 --> 01:03:55,311
By what name are you known?

789
01:03:55,388 --> 01:03:58,769
There some who call me...

790
01:03:58,848 --> 01:04:00,193
Tim.

791
01:04:00,269 --> 01:04:02,266
Greetings, Tim the Enchanter.

792
01:04:02,346 --> 01:04:04,228
Greetings, King Arthur.

793
01:04:05,228 --> 01:04:07,110
- You know my name?
- I do!

794
01:04:14,646 --> 01:04:17,182
You seek the Holy Grail.

795
01:04:17,221 --> 01:04:20,487
That is our quest. You know much
that is hidden, O Tim.

796
01:04:20,527 --> 01:04:21,872
Quite.

797
01:04:29,867 --> 01:04:32,479
Yes, we're looking
for the Holy Grail.

798
01:04:32,557 --> 01:04:34,593
Our quest is to find
the Holy Grail.

799
01:04:34,634 --> 01:04:36,555
Yes, it is. Yeah.

800
01:04:39,323 --> 01:04:41,551
And so we're looking for it.

801
01:04:41,591 --> 01:04:44,896
- Yes. We have been for some time.
- Ages.

802
01:04:47,895 --> 01:04:51,353
So anything that
you could do to help...

803
01:04:51,431 --> 01:04:54,466
would be...

804
01:04:54,544 --> 01:04:57,618
very helpful.

805
01:04:57,658 --> 01:04:59,271
Can you tell us--

806
01:05:03,424 --> 01:05:06,191
Fine. I don't want to waste
any more of your time.

807
01:05:06,268 --> 01:05:10,380
But I don't suppose you could telI us
where we might find a--

808
01:05:13,033 --> 01:05:14,493
A what?

809
01:05:16,800 --> 01:05:19,643
- A grail?
- Yes, I think so.

810
01:05:20,606 --> 01:05:23,142
- Yes.
- Yes.

811
01:05:23,220 --> 01:05:25,410
Yes!

812
01:05:25,487 --> 01:05:27,869
- Oh, thank you.
- Splendid.

813
01:05:32,214 --> 01:05:35,327
Look, you're a busy man and--

814
01:05:35,365 --> 01:05:39,400
Yes, I can help you find
the Holy Grail.

815
01:05:39,478 --> 01:05:42,245
To the north there lies a cave...

816
01:05:42,323 --> 01:05:44,628
the cave of Caerbannog...

817
01:05:44,706 --> 01:05:49,241
wherein carved in mystic runes
upon the very living rock...

818
01:05:49,280 --> 01:05:52,777
the last words
of Olfin Bedwere of Rheged...

819
01:05:54,930 --> 01:05:59,503
make plain the last resting place
of the most Holy Grail.

820
01:05:59,543 --> 01:06:01,771
Where could we find this cave,
O Tim?

821
01:06:01,850 --> 01:06:03,991
follow!

822
01:06:04,069 --> 01:06:08,430
But follow only
if ye be men of valor!

823
01:06:08,506 --> 01:06:12,637
for the entrance to this cave
is guarded by a creature...

824
01:06:12,714 --> 01:06:15,773
so foul, so cruel...

825
01:06:15,851 --> 01:06:19,102
that no man yet
has tought with it and lived!

826
01:06:20,021 --> 01:06:22,966
Bones of full 50 men...

827
01:06:23,043 --> 01:06:25,567
lie strewn about its lair!

828
01:06:25,644 --> 01:06:27,173
So, brave knights...

829
01:06:27,251 --> 01:06:31,612
if you do doubt your courage
or your strength...

830
01:06:31,689 --> 01:06:35,896
come no further,
for death awaits you all...

831
01:06:35,935 --> 01:06:39,186
with nasty, big, pointy teeth.

832
01:06:40,641 --> 01:06:43,203
What an eccentric performance.

833
01:06:55,254 --> 01:06:59,079
- They're nervous, sire.
- We best leave them and go on toot.

834
01:06:59,156 --> 01:07:00,877
Dismount!

835
01:07:13,426 --> 01:07:18,015
Behold the cave of Caerbannog.

836
01:07:19,393 --> 01:07:21,381
Right. Keep me covered.

837
01:07:21,459 --> 01:07:24,136
- What with?
- Just keep me covered.

838
01:07:24,214 --> 01:07:25,399
Too late!

839
01:07:25,476 --> 01:07:26,776
What?

840
01:07:26,854 --> 01:07:28,689
There he is!

841
01:07:30,832 --> 01:07:32,247
- Where?
- There!

842
01:07:33,472 --> 01:07:34,963
Behind the rabbit?

843
01:07:35,040 --> 01:07:36,875
It is the rabbit.

844
01:07:38,789 --> 01:07:40,548
You silly sod!

845
01:07:40,625 --> 01:07:42,498
- What?
- You got us all worked up!

846
01:07:42,576 --> 01:07:44,526
That's no ordinary rabbit.

847
01:07:44,604 --> 01:07:49,347
That's the most foul, cruel
and bad-tempered rodent you ever saw.

848
01:07:49,425 --> 01:07:52,981
You tit! I soiled my armor
I was so scared.

849
01:07:53,059 --> 01:07:57,342
That rabbit's got a vicious streak.
It's a killer.

850
01:07:57,420 --> 01:08:00,059
- Get stuffed!
- He'll do you up a treat, mate.

851
01:08:00,136 --> 01:08:02,048
You mangy Scots git!

852
01:08:02,125 --> 01:08:04,611
- I'm warning you.
- What's he do, nibble your bum?

853
01:08:04,688 --> 01:08:06,676
He's got huge, sharp--

854
01:08:07,672 --> 01:08:09,584
He can leap about--

855
01:08:09,661 --> 01:08:13,026
- Look at the bones!
- Go on, Bors. Chop his head off.

856
01:08:13,105 --> 01:08:17,503
Right. Silly little bleeder.
One rabbit stew coming right up.

857
01:08:18,919 --> 01:08:20,869
Look!

858
01:08:23,051 --> 01:08:24,542
Jesus Christ!

859
01:08:24,619 --> 01:08:27,143
- I warned you.
- I've done it again.

860
01:08:27,221 --> 01:08:31,467
I warned you, but did you listen to me?
Oh, no. You knew it all, didn't you?

861
01:08:31,544 --> 01:08:34,221
Oh, it's just a harmless
little bunny, isn't it?

862
01:08:34,259 --> 01:08:36,974
Well, it's always the same.
I always telI them--

863
01:08:37,053 --> 01:08:38,812
Shut up!

864
01:08:38,850 --> 01:08:40,991
Right. Charge!

865
01:08:57,557 --> 01:08:59,584
Run away! Run away!

866
01:09:08,575 --> 01:09:10,563
How many did we lose?

867
01:09:10,603 --> 01:09:11,941
- Gawain.
- Ector.

868
01:09:12,018 --> 01:09:14,083
- And Bors. That's five.
- Three, sir.

869
01:09:14,161 --> 01:09:18,865
Three. We better not risk another
frontal assault. That rabbit's dynamite.

870
01:09:18,943 --> 01:09:21,429
Would it heIp to confuse it
if we run away more?

871
01:09:21,505 --> 01:09:23,685
Oh, shut up.
Go and change your armor.

872
01:09:23,762 --> 01:09:27,548
Let us taunt it. It may become so cross
that it will make a mistake.

873
01:09:27,626 --> 01:09:29,270
Like what?

874
01:09:29,998 --> 01:09:31,374
Well--

875
01:09:34,053 --> 01:09:35,888
Have we got bows?

876
01:09:35,966 --> 01:09:39,982
- We have the HoIy Hand Grenade.
- Yes. The Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch.

877
01:09:40,060 --> 01:09:43,540
'Tis one of the sacred relics Brother
Maynard carries. Brother Maynard.

878
01:09:43,617 --> 01:09:46,524
Bring up the Holy Hand Grenade.

879
01:10:16,250 --> 01:10:19,905
- How does it-- How does it work?
- I don't know, my Liege.

880
01:10:19,981 --> 01:10:21,827
Consult the "Book of Armaments."

881
01:10:21,905 --> 01:10:26,213
Armaments, chapter two,
verses 9 to 21.

882
01:10:28,638 --> 01:10:33,024
"And St. Attila raised
the hand grenade up on high saying...

883
01:10:33,102 --> 01:10:36,102
'O Lord, bless this thy hand grenade...

884
01:10:36,179 --> 01:10:39,372
that with it thou mayest blow
thine enemies to tiny bits...

885
01:10:39,450 --> 01:10:41,296
in Thy mercy.'

886
01:10:41,374 --> 01:10:43,220
And the Lord did grin...

887
01:10:43,297 --> 01:10:47,297
and the peopIe did feast upon
the lambs and sloths and carp...

888
01:10:47,376 --> 01:10:51,915
and anchovies and orangutans
and breakfast cereals and fruit bats--"

889
01:10:51,993 --> 01:10:54,493
Skip a bit, Brother.

890
01:10:54,571 --> 01:10:57,071
"And the Lord spake saying...

891
01:10:57,149 --> 01:11:00,573
'First shaIt thou take out
the holy pin...

892
01:11:00,650 --> 01:11:03,111
then shalt thou count to three...

893
01:11:03,190 --> 01:11:05,805
no more, no less.

894
01:11:05,883 --> 01:11:08,306
Three shall be the number
thou shalt count...

895
01:11:08,383 --> 01:11:10,960
and the number of the counting
shall be three.

896
01:11:11,962 --> 01:11:15,809
four shalt thou not count,
neither count thou two...

897
01:11:15,887 --> 01:11:18,733
excepting that thou
then proceed to three.

898
01:11:19,772 --> 01:11:21,734
Five is right out.

899
01:11:23,082 --> 01:11:26,774
Once the number three,
being the third number, be reached...

900
01:11:26,852 --> 01:11:30,045
then lobbest thou
thy Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch...

901
01:11:30,122 --> 01:11:32,045
towards thy foe...

902
01:11:32,123 --> 01:11:35,623
who, being naughty in My sight,
shall snuff it."'

903
01:11:36,548 --> 01:11:38,894
- Amen.
- Amen.

904
01:11:38,972 --> 01:11:40,587
Right.

905
01:11:40,665 --> 01:11:42,858
One, two, five.

906
01:11:42,935 --> 01:11:45,628
- Three, sir!
- Three!

907
01:12:29,183 --> 01:12:31,182
There! Look!

908
01:12:31,260 --> 01:12:33,414
- What does it say?
- What language is that?

909
01:12:33,492 --> 01:12:36,953
- Brother Maynard, you're our schoIar.
- It's Aramaic.

910
01:12:37,763 --> 01:12:40,687
Of course.
Joseph of Arimathea.

911
01:12:40,764 --> 01:12:42,687
- Of course.
- What does it say?

912
01:12:42,726 --> 01:12:46,804
It reads, "Here may be found...

913
01:12:46,882 --> 01:12:50,228
the last words
of Joseph of Arimathea.

914
01:12:50,306 --> 01:12:53,499
He who is valiant
and pure of spirit...

915
01:12:53,577 --> 01:12:56,577
may find the Holy Grail...

916
01:12:56,654 --> 01:13:01,078
in the castle of A-a-a-argh."

917
01:13:02,657 --> 01:13:04,464
What?

918
01:13:04,542 --> 01:13:07,811
"The castle of A-a-a-argh."

919
01:13:08,658 --> 01:13:10,542
What is that?

920
01:13:10,621 --> 01:13:12,698
He must have died while carving it.

921
01:13:12,775 --> 01:13:15,468
- Oh, come on !
- Well, that's what it says.

922
01:13:15,546 --> 01:13:20,239
If he was dying he wouldn't bother
to carve "A-a-a-argh." He'd just say it.

923
01:13:20,278 --> 01:13:22,624
That's what's carved in the rock.

924
01:13:22,702 --> 01:13:26,126
- Perhaps he was dictating.
- Shut up. Does it say anything else?

925
01:13:26,204 --> 01:13:27,934
No. Just...

926
01:13:28,012 --> 01:13:29,896
"A-a-a-argh."

927
01:13:34,784 --> 01:13:38,245
Do you suppose he meant
the Camargue?

928
01:13:38,285 --> 01:13:40,284
- Where's that?
- In France, I think.

929
01:13:40,362 --> 01:13:43,362
lsn't there a St. A-a-a-argh's
in Cornwall?

930
01:13:43,441 --> 01:13:45,403
- That's St. lves.
- Oh, yes.

931
01:13:49,366 --> 01:13:51,520
No, no. A-a-a-argh.
Back of the throat.

932
01:13:51,598 --> 01:13:55,175
No, no. "O-o-oh" in surprise and alarm.

933
01:13:55,253 --> 01:13:58,253
- You mean sort of a "aaah"!
- Yes, that's right.

934
01:13:58,331 --> 01:14:00,524
Oh, my God!

935
01:14:03,102 --> 01:14:06,487
It's the legendary
Black Beast of--

936
01:14:07,719 --> 01:14:10,565
That's it! Run away!

937
01:14:20,454 --> 01:14:21,877
Keep running!

938
01:14:26,071 --> 01:14:27,917
We've lost him.

939
01:14:29,342 --> 01:14:32,688
As the horrendous Black Beast
lunged forward...

940
01:14:32,766 --> 01:14:35,420
escape for Arthur and his knights
seemed hopeless...

941
01:14:35,498 --> 01:14:38,498
when suddenly the animator
suffered a fatal heart attack.

942
01:14:39,846 --> 01:14:42,500
The cartoon peril was no more.

943
01:14:42,577 --> 01:14:45,885
The quest for the Holy Grail
could continue.

944
01:14:57,044 --> 01:15:00,621
There it is!
The Bridge of Death.

945
01:15:00,700 --> 01:15:02,081
Oh, great.

946
01:15:03,732 --> 01:15:07,033
Look! There's the old man
from scene 24.

947
01:15:07,111 --> 01:15:10,181
-What's he doing here?
-He's the keeper of the Bridge of Death.

948
01:15:10,259 --> 01:15:12,754
He asks each traveler
five questions--

949
01:15:12,830 --> 01:15:14,710
- Three questions.
- Three questions.

950
01:15:14,788 --> 01:15:17,973
- He who answers the five questions--
- Three questions.

951
01:15:18,051 --> 01:15:20,468
Three questions.
May cross in satety.

952
01:15:20,546 --> 01:15:22,388
What if you get a question wrong?

953
01:15:22,466 --> 01:15:25,767
Then you are cast
into the Gorge of Eternal Peril.

954
01:15:25,844 --> 01:15:27,532
I won't go.

955
01:15:27,572 --> 01:15:29,989
- Who's gonna answer the questions?
- Sir Robin.

956
01:15:30,067 --> 01:15:32,599
- Yes?
- Brave Sir Robin, you go.

957
01:15:32,677 --> 01:15:36,707
I've got a great idea.
Why doesn't Lancelot go?

958
01:15:36,784 --> 01:15:39,316
Yes, let me go.
I wiIl take it single-handed.

959
01:15:39,395 --> 01:15:43,003
-I shall make a feint to the northeast--
-No. Hang on.

960
01:15:43,043 --> 01:15:45,614
- Just answer the five questions--
- Three questions.

961
01:15:45,691 --> 01:15:47,571
Three questions as best you can.

962
01:15:47,648 --> 01:15:49,758
And we shall watch and pray.

963
01:15:49,836 --> 01:15:51,486
I understand.

964
01:15:51,526 --> 01:15:55,210
Good luck, brave Sir Lancelot.
God be with you.

965
01:15:59,357 --> 01:16:00,853
Stop!

966
01:16:01,930 --> 01:16:06,267
Who would cross the Bridge of Death
must answer me these questions three...

967
01:16:06,344 --> 01:16:08,876
ere the other side he see.

968
01:16:08,954 --> 01:16:11,563
Ask me the questions, bridge keeper.
I am not afraid.

969
01:16:11,641 --> 01:16:13,905
What is your name?

970
01:16:13,983 --> 01:16:16,093
My name is Sir Lancelot of Camelot.

971
01:16:16,171 --> 01:16:20,354
- What is your quest?
- To seek the Holy Grail.

972
01:16:20,432 --> 01:16:24,078
- What is your favorite color?
- Blue.

973
01:16:24,156 --> 01:16:25,691
Right. Off you go.

974
01:16:26,996 --> 01:16:29,375
Oh, thank you very much.

975
01:16:32,717 --> 01:16:34,482
That's easy!

976
01:16:36,478 --> 01:16:37,706
Stop!

977
01:16:38,859 --> 01:16:43,464
Who approacheth the Bridge of Death
must answer me these questions three...

978
01:16:43,542 --> 01:16:45,883
ere the other side he see.

979
01:16:46,690 --> 01:16:49,376
Ask me the questions.
I am not afraid.

980
01:16:49,454 --> 01:16:52,678
- What is your name?
- Sir Robin of Camelot.

981
01:16:52,717 --> 01:16:56,248
- What is your quest?
- To seek the Holy Grail.

982
01:16:56,325 --> 01:16:58,820
What is the capital of Assyria?

983
01:17:01,431 --> 01:17:03,388
I don't know that!

984
01:17:10,683 --> 01:17:12,601
Stop!

985
01:17:12,679 --> 01:17:16,095
- What is your name?
- Sir Galahad of Camelot.

986
01:17:16,172 --> 01:17:20,048
- What is your quest?
- I seek the Grail.

987
01:17:20,126 --> 01:17:23,081
What is your favorite color?

988
01:17:23,159 --> 01:17:25,384
Blue. No, yel--

989
01:17:32,640 --> 01:17:35,749
Stop! What is your name?

990
01:17:35,788 --> 01:17:37,745
It is Arthur, king of the Britons.

991
01:17:37,823 --> 01:17:41,892
- What is your quest?
- To seek the Holy Grail.

992
01:17:41,969 --> 01:17:45,922
What is the airspeed velocity
of an unIaden swallow?

993
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:49,063
What do you mean,
an atrican or a European swallow?

994
01:17:50,136 --> 01:17:51,973
I don't know that.

995
01:17:57,718 --> 01:18:00,092
How do you know
so much about swallows?

996
01:18:00,169 --> 01:18:02,849
You have to know these things
when you're a king.

997
01:18:40,877 --> 01:18:42,408
Lancelot?

998
01:19:03,625 --> 01:19:07,492
Arthur

999
01:20:43,614 --> 01:20:45,528
The Castle A-a-a-argh.

1000
01:20:45,605 --> 01:20:47,979
Our quest is at an end.

1001
01:21:05,749 --> 01:21:07,739
God be praised!

1002
01:21:10,421 --> 01:21:12,910
Almighty God, we thank Thee...

1003
01:21:12,987 --> 01:21:16,892
that Thou has brought sate to us
the most Holy--

1004
01:21:17,927 --> 01:21:19,764
Jesus Christ!

1005
01:21:20,608 --> 01:21:22,904
Hello, dafty English "kniggits"...

1006
01:21:22,982 --> 01:21:26,006
and Monsieur Arthur King
who has the brain of a duck.

1007
01:21:26,084 --> 01:21:29,032
So we French fellows
outwit you a second time.

1008
01:21:29,109 --> 01:21:32,478
How dare you profane this place
with your presence!

1009
01:21:32,556 --> 01:21:36,385
I command you, in the name
of the Knights of Camelot...

1010
01:21:36,462 --> 01:21:39,870
to open the doors
of this sacred castle...

1011
01:21:39,947 --> 01:21:42,742
to which God HimseIf has guided us!

1012
01:21:42,781 --> 01:21:45,691
How you EngIish say,
I one more time...

1013
01:21:45,767 --> 01:21:49,557
unclog my nose in your direction,
sons of a window dresser.

1014
01:21:49,635 --> 01:21:52,161
So you think you could
out-clever us French folk...

1015
01:21:52,240 --> 01:21:55,456
with your silIy knees-bent,
running-about advancing behavior!

1016
01:21:55,533 --> 01:21:58,443
I wave my private parts
at your aunties...

1017
01:21:58,520 --> 01:22:03,038
you cheesy lot of secondhand
electric-donkey bottom biters!

1018
01:22:03,116 --> 01:22:05,183
In the name of the Lord...

1019
01:22:05,260 --> 01:22:08,399
we demand entrance
to this sacred castle!

1020
01:22:08,477 --> 01:22:11,003
No chance, English bed-wetting types.

1021
01:22:11,081 --> 01:22:15,714
I burst my pimples at you and call
your door-opening request a silly thing.

1022
01:22:15,791 --> 01:22:19,121
You tiny-brained wipers
of other people's bottoms!

1023
01:22:19,200 --> 01:22:23,488
If you do not open this door,
we shall take this castle by force.

1024
01:22:24,484 --> 01:22:27,394
In the name of God
and the glory of our--

1025
01:22:29,118 --> 01:22:31,607
Right! That settles it!

1026
01:22:31,684 --> 01:22:34,670
Yes! Depart at this time
and cut the approaching...

1027
01:22:34,748 --> 01:22:39,304
or we fire arrows into your heads and
make castanets out of your testicles.

1028
01:22:39,381 --> 01:22:41,218
Walk away. Just ignore them.

1029
01:22:41,296 --> 01:22:44,934
Now remain gone,
illegitimate-faced bugger folk!

1030
01:22:44,973 --> 01:22:48,303
If you think you got
a nasty taunting this time...

1031
01:22:48,381 --> 01:22:50,601
you ain't heard nothing yet...

1032
01:22:50,679 --> 01:22:53,053
dafty English "kniggits"!

1033
01:23:13,579 --> 01:23:16,603
- We shall attack at once!
- Yes, my Liege.

1034
01:23:16,681 --> 01:23:18,786
Stand by for attack!

1035
01:24:15,197 --> 01:24:17,187
French persons!

1036
01:24:17,916 --> 01:24:22,089
Today the blood of many a valiant knight
shall be avenged!

1037
01:24:22,166 --> 01:24:25,459
In the name of God,
we shall not stop our fight...

1038
01:24:25,537 --> 01:24:28,063
till each one of you Iies dead...

1039
01:24:28,141 --> 01:24:29,978
and the Holy Grail...

1040
01:24:30,055 --> 01:24:34,266
returns to those
whom God has chosen!

1041
01:24:34,344 --> 01:24:36,219
Charge!

1042
01:25:02,453 --> 01:25:04,367
Yes, they're the ones.
I'm sure.

1043
01:25:04,445 --> 01:25:07,048
Don't let any of them go through.

1044
01:25:07,125 --> 01:25:08,962
That's them. Yes.

1045
01:25:09,040 --> 01:25:11,950
Move along. Come on.

1046
01:25:14,861 --> 01:25:17,272
This one. Come on.
Put him in the van.

1047
01:25:17,350 --> 01:25:19,302
Get a blanket on that one.

1048
01:25:19,379 --> 01:25:21,905
Come on, back.
Right back. Come on.

1049
01:25:23,324 --> 01:25:26,042
Put that over there.
That's an offensive weapon, that is.

1050
01:25:26,120 --> 01:25:27,689
Back. Come on.

1051
01:25:29,107 --> 01:25:31,403
All right, sonny, that's enough.
Just pack that in.

1052
01:25:31,443 --> 01:25:32,705
Christ!
