1
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:43,795
Stop that! Stop that!

2
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:46,679
Go on, be off! Go away.

3
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:51,073
And you, be off!

4
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:57,349
Bloody weather.

5
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:59,751
<i>The tale of Sir Lancelot.</i>

6
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:09,038
One day, lad, all this will be yours.

7
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:11,549
. What, the curtains?
. No, not the curtains.

8
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:15,918
All that you can see,
stretched out over the hills and valleys.

9
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,752
That'll be your kingdom, lad.

10
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:19,512
. But, Mother.
. Father, lad.

11
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:23,150
. But, Father, I don't want any of that.
. Listen, lad.

12
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:28,115
I built this kingdom up from nothing.
When I started here, it was a swamp.

13
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:31,352
Other kings said I was daft
to build a castle on the swamp.

14
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:34,432
But I built it all the same to show them.

15
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:36,638
It sank into the swamp.

16
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:39,439
So, I built a second one.
That sank into the swamp.

17
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:43,195
So, I built a third one. That burned down,
fell over, then sank in the swamp.

18
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:45,191
But the fourth one stayed up.

19
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,991
And that's what you'll get, lad.

20
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:52,636
. The strongest castle in these isles.
. But I don't want any of that.

21
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,918
. I'd <i>rather...</i>
. Rather what?

22
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,758
I'd rather just...

23
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:00,873
...sing.
. Stop that.

24
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:03,633
You're not going into a song
while I'm here!

25
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:05,950
In 20 minutes, you're marrying a girl...

26
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:09,874
...whose father owns
the biggest tracts of open land in Britain.

27
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,639
. But I don't want land.
. Listen, Alice.

28
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,278
. Herbert.
. Herbert.

29
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:17,591
We live on a bloody swamp,
we need all the land we can get.

30
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:20,879
. But I don't like her.
. Don't like her?

31
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:23,039
What's wrong with her?

32
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:27,238
She's beautiful, she's rich.
She's got huge...

33
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,273
...tracts of land.

34
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:35,154
I know, but I want the girl
that I marry to have...

35
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:39,230
...a certain special something.

36
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,150
Cut that out!

37
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:47,792
You're marrying Princess Lucky,
so you'd better get used to the idea!

38
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:50,069
Guards!

39
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:53,637
Make sure the Prince doesn't leave
the room until I get him.

40
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:56,553
Not to leave the room,
even if you come and get him.

41
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,596
No. Until I come and get him.

42
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:01,992
Until you come and get him,
we're not to enter the room.

43
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:06,750
No, you stay in the room
and make sure he doesn't leave.

44
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:09,429
. And you'll come and get him.
. Right.

45
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:13,035
We don't need to do anything,
apart from stop him entering the room.

46
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:16,312
. No. Leaving the room.
. Leaving the room, yes.

47
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,556
. All right?
. lf...

48
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,949
. lf <i>we're...</i>
. Yes?

49
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,676
Look, it's quite simple.

50
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:28,799
You stay here and make sure
he doesn't leave the room.

51
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,911
. All right?
. I remember.

52
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:34,350
Can he can he leave the room with us?

53
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:38,435
No, you just keep him in here,
and make <i>sure...</i>

54
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:40,715
Yes! We'll keep him in here, obviously.

55
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:43,837
. But if he had to <i>leave...</i>
. No. Keep him in here!

56
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:46,554
. Until you, or <i>anyone...</i>
. Not anyone, just me.

57
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,915
. Just you...
. Get back.

58
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,195
. Right?
. Right.

59
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:52,191
We'll stay here until you get back.

60
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:54,953
. And make sure he doesn't leave.
. What?

61
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:59,198
. Make sure he doesn't leave.
. The Prince?

62
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:02,477
. Yes, make sure he doesn't leave.
. Yes, of course!

63
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,118
I thought you meant him!

64
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:07,715
It seemed a bit daft
me having to guard him when he's a guard.

65
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:10,833
. Is that clear?
. Quite clear. No problems.

66
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:11,989
Right.

67
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:16,634
. Where are you going?
. We're coming with you.

68
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:20,679
I want you to stay here,
and make sure he doesn't leave.

69
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,354
I see, right.

70
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:26,635
. But, <i>Father...</i>
. Shut it, and get that suit on.

71
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,911
And no singing!

72
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,151
Go and get a glass of water.

73
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:27,428
. Well taken, Concorde!
. Thank you, sir, most kind.

74
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:28,999
And again!

75
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:32,272
Over we go! Good, steady!

76
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:34,476
Now, the big one!

77
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,236
Come on, Concorde!

78
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:40,311
Message for you, sir.

79
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,597
Concorde, speak to me!

80
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,472
"To whoever finds this note...

81
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:59,473
"...I have been imprisoned by my father...

82
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:02,354
"...who wishes me to marry
against my will.

83
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:04,874
"Please, please come and rescue me.

84
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:08,670
"I am in the tall tower of Swamp Castle."

85
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:11,911
At last! A call! A cry of distress!

86
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,037
This could be the sign
that leads us to the Holy Grail!

87
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:19,551
Brave Concorde,
you shall not have died in vain!

88
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:21,518
I'm not quite dead, sir.

89
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:26,034
You shall not have been mortally wounded
in vain!

90
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:28,315
I think I could pull through, sir.

91
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:31,709
. I see.
. I think I'm all right to come with you.

92
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,472
No, sweet Concorde! Stay here.

93
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:36,597
I will send help as soon as
I have accomplished a daring and...

94
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:39,319
...heroic rescue in my own particular...

95
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:44,198
. Idiom, sir?
. Idiom!

96
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:47,591
. No, I feel fine, actually, sir.
. Farewell, sweet Concorde!

97
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:51,597
I'll just stay here, shall I, sir?

98
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:54,629
Yeah.

99
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:17,469
Hey!

100
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,950
You're not allowed to enter the <i>room...</i>

101
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:13,798
Fair one, behold your servant,
Sir Lancelot of Camelot.

102
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:17,634
. I have come to take... I'm terribly sorry.
. You got my note!

103
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:21,669
. I got a note.
. You've come to rescue me?

104
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,753
. Well, no, you <i>see...</i>
. I knew someone would.

105
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:29,477
I knew that somewhere out there,
there must be <i>someone...</i>

106
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,356
Stop that! Stop it!

107
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:34,795
Who are you?

108
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,438
. I'm your son.
. No, not you.

109
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:39,592
. I'm Sir Lancelot, sir.
. He's come to rescue me, Father.

110
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:43,719
. Let's not jump to conclusions.
. Did you kill all those guards?

111
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:45,558
Yes. Sorry.

112
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:47,995
. They cost 50 pounds each.
. I'm awfully sorry.

113
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:51,993
Don't be afraid of him, Sir Lancelot.
I've got a rope ready.

114
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,995
You killed eight wedding guests and all!

115
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:57,390
Well, you see,
I thought your son was a lady.

116
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:58,754
I can understand that.

117
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:01,070
. Hurry, Sir Lancelot! Hurry!
. Shut up!

118
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:04,436
. You only killed the bride's father!
. I didn't mean to.

119
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:07,159
Didn't mean to?
You put your sword through his head!

120
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:10,118
. Oh dear, is he all right?
. You kicked the bride in the chest!

121
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:12,589
. It's going to cost me a fortune!
. I can explain.

122
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:16,309
I was in the forest, riding north
from Camelot when I got this note.

123
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:18,914
. Are you from Camelot?
. Hurry, Sir Lancelot!

124
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,871
I'm a knight of King Arthur, sir.

125
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:23,872
Very nice castle, Camelot.
Very good pig country.

126
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:27,632
. Is it?
. I am ready!

127
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:31,315
. Would you like to come have a drink?
. That's awfully nice of you.

128
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:34,677
. I am ready!
. I mean, to be so understanding.

129
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:38,514
You see, when I'm in this idiom,
I sometimes get a bit carried away.

130
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:48,230
Now, this is the main hall.
We'll have all this knocked <i>through...</i>

131
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:51,869
. There he is!
. Bloody hell.

132
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:04,475
. Hold it, please!
. See what I mean? I get carried away.

133
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:07,358
I'm really most awfully sorry.
Sorry, everyone.

134
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,793
He's killed the best man!

135
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:14,876
Hold it, please, hold it.
This is Sir Lancelot...

136
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:19,875
...from the Court of Camelot,
a brave and influential knight.

137
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:23,033
. And my special guest here today.
. Hello.

138
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,633
He killed my auntie!

139
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:29,837
No, please!
This is supposed to be a happy occasion!

140
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:33,708
Let's not bicker and argue
about who killed who.

141
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:38,752
We are here today to witness the union
of two young people...

142
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:41,110
...in the joyful bond of holy wedlock.

143
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:46,309
Unfortunately, one of them,
my son Herbert...

144
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,031
...has just fallen to his death.

145
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:53,196
But I don't want to think I've lost a son,
so much as...

146
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:55,278
...gained a daughter.

147
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:59,077
For, since the tragic death of her <i>father...</i>

148
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:01,151
He's not quite dead!

149
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:05,392
Since the near fatal wounding
of her <i>father...</i>

150
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:07,869
He's getting better!

151
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:12,237
For, since her own father...

152
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:15,517
...who, when he seemed about to recover...

153
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:19,270
...suddenly felt the icy hand of death
upon him.

154
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,275
He's died!

155
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:25,275
I want his only daughter to look upon me...

156
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:29,638
...as her own dad, in a very real,
and legally binding sense.

157
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:35,916
And I feel sure that the merger...
The union between the Princess...

158
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:40,149
...and the brave but dangerous
Sir Lancelot of <i>Camelot...</i>

159
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:43,558
. What?
. Look, the dead Prince!

160
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:49,516
. He's not quite dead!
. I feel much better.

161
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:52,353
You fell out of the tall tower, you creep!

162
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:56,269
. No, I was saved at the last minute.
. How?

163
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:58,112
I'll tell you.

164
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:01,834
Not like that! Not like that.

165
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:05,390
"He's going tell
He's going to tell"

166
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:11,551
Quickly, sir, come this way!

167
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:15,349
No, it's not right for my idiom.
I must escape more...

168
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:20,232
. Dramatically, sir?
. Dramatically.

169
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:34,314
Excuse me,
could somebody give me a push, please?

170
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:51,312
Old crone!

171
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:56,230
Is there anywhere in this town
where we could buy a shrubbery?

172
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:00,396
. Who sent you?
. The knights who say, "Ni"!

173
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:03,239
No! We have no shrubberies here.

174
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:07,279
If you do not tell us where we can buy
a shrubbery, my friend and I...

175
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:08,834
...will say...

176
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,719
We will say, "Ni."

177
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:14,554
Do your worst!

178
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:18,599
Very well.
If you will not assist us voluntarily...

179
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:23,275
...Ni!
. No!

180
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,195
Never. No shrubberies.

181
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:28,160
. Ni!
. Noo!

182
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:30,196
No, it's not that, it's "Ni."

183
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:34,720
No, you're not doing it properly.

184
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,073
. Ni.
. You've got it.

185
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:38,230
. Ni!
. Ni!

186
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:41,278
Are you saying "Ni" to that old woman?

187
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:43,150
Yes.

188
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:48,268
What sad times are these when passing
ruffians can say, "Ni" at will to old ladies.

189
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:51,912
There is a pestilence upon this land.
Nothing is sacred.

190
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:55,869
Even those who arrange shrubberies
are under considerable economic stress...

191
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:57,871
...at this period in history.

192
00:14:57,960 --> 00:15:00,554
. Did you say "shrubberies"?
. Yes.

193
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:03,552
Shrubberies are my trade.
I am a shrubber.

194
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:08,031
My name is Roger the Shrubber.
I arrange, design, and sell shrubberies.

195
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,916
. Ni!
. No!

196
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:14,713
Knights of Ni,
we have brought you your shrubbery.

197
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:17,030
. May we go?
. It is a good shrubbery.

198
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:21,392
I like the laurels particularly.
But there is one small problem.

199
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:22,989
What is that?

200
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:26,880
We are now no longer
the knights who say "Ni."

201
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:28,280
We are now the knights who say:

202
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:29,872
"Ekke Ekke Ekke Ptang Zoo Boing"!

203
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:36,480
Therefore, we must give you a test.

204
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:39,950
What's is this test,
knights who until recently said "Ni"?

205
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:42,710
Firstly, you must find...

206
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:45,072
...another shrubbery!

207
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:48,555
Not another shrubbery!

208
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:52,235
Then you must bring it here
beside this shrubbery.

209
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:55,830
Higher, so you get the two. Level effect,
a path going down the middle.

210
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:57,876
A path! A path!

211
00:15:57,960 --> 00:16:00,952
Then, when you have found
the shrubberies...

212
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:04,471
...you must cut down
the mightiest tree in the forest...

213
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:08,237
...with a herring!

214
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:12,000
. We shall do no such thing.
. Please.

215
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:15,392
Cut down a tree with a herring?
It can't be done.

216
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:18,877
. Don't say that word.
. What word?

217
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:20,871
I cannot tell. Suffice to say...

218
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:23,554
...it's one of the words
the knights of Ni cannot hear.

219
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:26,438
How can we not say the word
if you don't tell us what it is?

220
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:28,556
. He did it again.
. What? "Is"?

221
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:32,394
You wouldn't get very far in life
not saying "is."

222
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:34,513
My liege, it's Robin.

223
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:38,832
"He's jacking it in and packing it up
And sneaking away and buggering up

224
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:43,357
"And chickening out and pissing a pot
Yes, bravely he is throwing in the sponge"

225
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:44,634
. Robin.
. My liege.

226
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,278
It's good to see you.

227
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:48,828
You haven't given up your quest
for the Holy Grail?

228
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:51,275
."He is sneaking away <i>and..."</i>
. Shut up!

229
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:54,149
. No, far from it.
. You said the word again.

230
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:58,631
I was looking for it here in this forest.

231
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:02,992
. No, it is far from this place.
. Stop saying the word!

232
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:05,435
. The word we cannot hear!
. Stop it!

233
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:07,556
. He said, "it" again!
. That's it!

234
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:10,518
I've said, "it." I've said, "it."
I've said, "it" again!

235
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:12,716
That's three "its"!

236
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:22,958
<i>And so Arthur and Bedevere and</i>
<i>Sir Robin set out on their search to find...</i>

237
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:26,794
<i>... the enchanter of whom</i>
<i>the old man had spoken in Scene 24.</i>

238
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:30,999
<i>Beyond the forest</i>
<i>they met Lancelot and Galahad...</i>

239
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:33,389
<i>... and there was much rejoicing.</i>

240
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:46,556
<i>In the frozen land of Nador...</i>

241
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:49,313
<i>... they were forced to eat</i>
<i>Robin's minstrels.</i>

242
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:52,474
<i>And there was much rejoicing.</i>

243
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:55,272
<i>A year passed.</i>

244
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:01,315
<i>Winter changed into spring.</i>

245
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:03,876
<i>Spring changed into summer.</i>

246
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,755
<i>Summer changed back into winter...</i>

247
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:12,073
<i>... and winter gave spring and summer</i>
<i>a miss and went straight on into autumn.</i>

248
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:13,589
<i>Until one day.</i>

249
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:36,876
Knights...

250
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:38,594
...forward!

251
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,514
What manner of man are you,
that can summon up fire...

252
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:21,230
...without flint or tinder?
. I am an enchanter.

253
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:27,515
. By what name are you known?
. There are some who call me...

254
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:32,114
...Tim.
. Greetings, Tim the enchanter!

255
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:34,475
Greetings, King Arthur.

256
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:36,872
. You know my name?
. I do.

257
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:47,194
You seek the Holy Grail.

258
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:50,758
That is our quest.
You know much that is hidden, Tim.

259
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:51,989
Quite.

260
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:02,229
Yes, we are looking for the Holy Grail.

261
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:06,234
. Our quest is to find the Holy Grail.
. Yes, it is.

262
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:12,437
. And so we're looking for it.
. Yes, we are.

263
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:15,239
. We have been for some time.
. Ages.

264
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:21,992
So, anything you could do to help
would be...

265
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:25,429
: : : very: : :

266
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:29,353
...helpful.
. Look, can you tell us <i>where...</i>

267
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:35,952
Fine, I don't want to waste
any more of your time...

268
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:39,794
...but I don't suppose you could tell us
where we might find a...

269
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:44,318
A what?

270
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:47,913
A grail?

271
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,070
Yes, I think so.

272
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:51,635
Yes.

273
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:53,829
Yes!

274
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:58,679
. Thank you.
. Splendid!

275
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:04,828
Look, you're a busy <i>man...</i>

276
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:09,391
Yes, I can help you find the Holy Grail.

277
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:14,396
To the north, there lies a cave.
The Cave of Caerbannog.

278
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:18,519
Wherein, carved in mystic runes,
upon the very living rock...

279
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:22,277
...the last words
of Olfin Bedwere of Rheged...

280
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:29,075
...make plain the last resting place
of the most Holy Grail.

281
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:32,912
. Where could we find this cave, Tim?
. Follow!

282
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:38,239
But follow only if ye be men of valour.

283
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:41,956
For the entrance to this cave
is guarded by a creature...

284
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:45,557
...so foul, so cruel...

285
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:48,757
...that no man yet
has fought with it and lived.

286
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:56,911
Bones of full 50 men lie strewn
about its lair. So, brave knights...

287
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:03,030
...if you do doubt your courage
or your strength, come no further...

288
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:08,114
...for death awaits you all
with nasty, big, pointy teeth.

289
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,197
What an eccentric performance!

290
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,553
They're nervous, sire.

291
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:29,154
Then we'd best leave them here
and carry on, on foot.

292
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:31,231
Dismount!

293
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:47,114
Behold the Cave of Caerbannog!

294
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:52,432
. Right, keep me covered.
. What with?

295
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:55,435
. Just keep me covered.
. Too late.

296
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:57,835
There he is!

297
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:02,870
. Where?
. There.

298
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:06,792
. What, behind the rabbit?
. It is the rabbit.

299
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:11,195
. You silly sod!
. What?

300
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:12,679
You got us all worked up.

301
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:14,398
That's no ordinary rabbit.

302
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:19,315
That's the most foul, cruel and
bad. Tempered rodent you ever set eyes on.

303
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:22,870
You tit! I soiled my armour
I was so scared!

304
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:26,356
Look, that rabbit's got
a vicious streak a mile wide.

305
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:28,351
. It's a killer!
. Get stuffed.

306
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:30,670
. He'll do you up a treat, mate!
. Yeah?

307
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:33,194
. You manky Scots git!
. I'm warning you.

308
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:36,795
. What's he do? Nibble your bum?
. He's got huge, sharp...

309
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:39,472
It can leap about...

310
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:43,196
. Look at the bones!
. Go on, Bors, chop its head off.

311
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:46,869
Right. Silly little bleeder.
One rabbit stew coming right up.

312
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:49,709
Look!

313
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:56,357
. Jesus Christ!
. I warned you!

314
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:58,431
. I've done it again.
. I warned you.

315
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:01,717
But did you listen to me?
No, you knew it all, didn't you?

316
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:06,237
It's just a harmless little bunny, isn't it?
Well, it's always the same.

317
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:08,834
. I <i>always...</i>
. Shut up!

318
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,992
Charge!

319
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,355
Run away!

320
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:41,316
. How many did we lose?
. Gawain.

321
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:43,356
. Ector.
. And Bors. That's five.

322
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:45,317
. Three.
. Three.

323
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:49,195
We better not risk another frontal assault,
that rabbit's dynamite.

324
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:51,794
Would it help to confuse it
if we run away more?

325
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:55,111
. Shut up and change your armour.
. Let us taunt it.

326
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:57,873
It may become so cross,
that it will make a mistake.

327
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:59,029
Like what?

328
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:01,269
Well...

329
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:06,197
. Have we got bows?
. No.

330
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:08,555
. We have the Holy Hand Grenade.
. Yes, of course!

331
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:10,312
The Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch.

332
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:13,119
It's one of the sacred relics
Brother Maynard carries.

333
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:16,158
Brother Maynard!
Bring up the Holy Hand Grenade.

334
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:47,588
How does it...

335
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:49,395
How does it work?

336
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:52,199
. I know not, my liege.
. Consult the Book of Armaments.

337
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:55,909
Armaments 2: 9.21.

338
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:02,874
"And St. Attila raised the hand grenade
up on high, saying:

339
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:07,519
"'O Lord, bless this thy hand grenade,
that with it thou mayest...

340
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:11,115
"'... blow thine enemies
to tiny bits, in thy mercy.'

341
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:14,718
"And the Lord did grin
and the people did feast upon...

342
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:19,794
"...the lambs and sloths and carp

"...and breakfast cereals
and fruit bats <i>and..."</i>

344
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:23,913
Skip a bit, Brother.

345
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:30,191
"The Lord spake, saying,
'First shalt thou take out the Holy Pin...

346
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:34,834
"'... then shalt thou count to three,
no more, no less.

347
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:38,634
"'Three shalt be the number
thou shalt count...

348
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:41,598
"'... and the number
of the counting shalt be three.

349

"'Four shalt thou not count,

350

"'... excepting that thou then

351
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:52,235
"'Five is right out.

00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:56,716

356
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:07,909
Amen.

357
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:09,109
Amen.

358
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:10,235
Right.

359
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:13,030
One, two, five!

360
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:14,917
. Three, sir!
. Three!

361
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,433
There! Look!

362
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:03,595
What does it say? What language is that?

363
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:05,830
Brother Maynard, you're our scholar.

364
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,479
It is Aramaic!

365
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:10,553
Of course. Joseph of Arimathea!

366
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:12,871
. Of course.
. What does it say?

367
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:16,197
It reads, "Here may be found...

368
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:19,750
"...the last words of Joseph of Arimathea:

369
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:23,557
"'He who is valiant and pure of spirit...

370
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:26,436
"'... may find the Holy Grail...

371
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:30,878
"'... in the Castle of Aaargh."'

372
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:33,835
What?

373
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:38,235
"The Castle of Aaargh."

374
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:40,074
What is that?

375
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:42,716
He must have died while carving it.

376
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:45,519
. Come on!
. That's what it says.

377
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:49,076
Look, if he was dying,
he wouldn't bother to carve "Aaargh."

378
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:52,556
. He'd just say it.
. That's what's carved in the rock.

379
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:54,831
. Perhaps he was dictating it.
. Shut up!

380
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:57,115
. Does it say anything else?
. No!

381
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:00,317
Just "Aaargh."

382
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:04,509
Aaargh.

383
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:08,195
Do you suppose he meant the Camargue?

384
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:10,191
. Where's that?
. In France, I think.

385
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:14,876
. Isn't there a St. Aaargh's in Cornwall?
. No, that's St. Ives.

386
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:17,230
St. Ives.

387
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:21,754
No, "Aaargh." At the back of the throat.

388
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:24,832
No, in surprise and alarm!

389
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:27,719
. You mean a sort of a "Ah!"
. Yes, that's right.

390
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:30,315
My God!

391
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:37,716
It's the Legendary Black Beast of Aaargh!

392
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:40,633
That's it! Run away!

393
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:57,268
We've lost him.

394
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,639
<i>As the horrendous Black Beast</i>
<i>lunged forward...</i>

395
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:04,993
<i>...escape for Arthur</i>
<i>and his knights seemed hopeless.</i>

396
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:08,914
<i>When, suddenly, the animator</i>
<i>suffered a fatal heart attack.</i>

397
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:11,708
<i>The cartoon peril was no more.</i>

398
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:15,233
<i>The quest for the Holy Grail</i>
<i>could continue.</i>

399
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:28,438
There it is!

400
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:32,719
. The Bridge of Death.
. Great.

401
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:35,713
Look! There's the old man from Scene 24.

402
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:39,395
. What's he doing here?
. He is the keeper of the Bridge of Death.

403
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:42,110
He asks each traveller five questions.

404
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:44,077
. Three questions.
. Three questions.

405
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:47,596
. He who answers the five <i>questions...</i>
. Three questions.

406
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:51,958
. Three questions, may cross in safety.
. What if you get a question wrong?

407
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:55,396
Then you are cast
into the gorge of eternal peril.

408
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:58,677
. Oh, wacko.
. Who's going to answer the questions?

409
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:01,519
Brave Sir Robin, you go.

410
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:04,151
I've got a great idea:

411
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:06,239
Why doesn't Lancelot go?

412
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:08,959
Yes, let me go, my liege.
I will take him single. Handed.

413
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:12,555
. I shall make a feint to the northeast...
. Hang on!

414
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:15,274
. Just answer the five <i>questions...</i>
. Three questions.

415
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:19,194
Three questions, as best you can.
And we shall watch and pray.

416
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:21,152
I understand, my liege.

417
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:24,870
Good luck, brave Sir Lancelot.
God be with you.

418
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:30,149
Stop!

419
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:36,117
Who would cross the Bridge of Death,
must answer me these questions three.

420
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:38,396
Ere the other side he see.

421
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:41,478
Ask me the questions, bridgekeeper.
I'm not afraid.

422
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:45,474
. What is your name?
. My name is Sir Lancelot of Camelot.

423
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:47,872
What is your quest?

424
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:50,076
To seek the Holy Grail.

425
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:52,596
What is your favourite colour?

426
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:55,190
. Blue.
. Right. Off you go.

427
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:58,431
Well, thank you very much.

428
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:03,869
That's easy.

429
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:07,789
Stop.

430
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:12,991
Who approacheth the Bridge of Death,
must answer me these questions three.

431
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:15,476
Ere the other side he see.

432
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:18,919
Ask me the questions, bridgekeeper.
I'm not afraid.

433
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:22,470
. What is your name?
. Sir Robin of Camelot.

434
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:25,912
. What is your quest?
. To seek the Holy Grail.

435
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:28,276
What is the capital of Assyria?

436
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,228
I don't know that!

437
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:41,516
Stop!

438
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:45,950
. What is your name?
. Sir Galahad of Camelot.

439
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:49,431
. What is your quest?
. I seek the Grail.

440
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:53,272
. What is your favourite colour?
. Blue.

441
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:55,069
No! Yellow!

442
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:03,229
Stop!

443
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:07,359
. What is your name?
. It is Arthur, King of the Britons.

444
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:11,275
. What is your quest?
. To seek the Holy Grail.

445
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:15,311
What is the air. Speed velocity
of an unladen swallow?

446
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:18,793
What do you mean?
An African or European swallow?

447
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:21,233
I don't know that!

448
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:29,515
How do you know
so much about swallows?

449
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:32,200
You have to know these things
when you're a king.

450
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:11,429
Lancelot!

451
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:18,869
Lancelot!

452
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:28,388
Lancelot!

453
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:17,195
The Castle Aaargh. Our quest is at an end.

454
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:37,113
God be praised.

455
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:41,959
Almighty God...

456
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:45,749
...we thank thee, that thou hast vouchsafed
to us the most <i>holy...</i>

457
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:48,437
Jesus Christ!

458
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:53,480
Dirty English knights.

459
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:56,040
<i>Monsieur</i> Arthur King,
who has the brain of a duck.

460
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:59,396
So, we French fellows
outwit you a second time.

461
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:02,398
How dare you profane this place
with your presence?

462
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:06,229
I command you,
in the name of the knights of Camelot...

463
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:09,313
...to open the doors of this sacred castle...

464
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:12,830
...to which God himself has guided us.

465
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:18,040
How you English say?
I'll unclog my nose in your direction.

466
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:19,553
Sons of a window. Dresser!

467
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:22,108
So, you think you could
out. Clever us French folk...

468
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:25,590
...with your silly knees. Bent,
running about, advancing behaviour.

469
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:28,353
I wave my private parts at your aunties.

470
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:33,031
You cheesy lot of second. Hand,
electric donkey. Bottom biters!

471
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:35,156
In the name of the Lord...

472
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:38,835
...we demand entrance
to this sacred castle!

473
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:41,593
No chance, English bed. Wetting types.

474
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:45,753
I burst my pimples at you, and call your
door. Opening request a silly thing!

475
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:49,116
You tiny. Brained wipers
of other people's bottoms.

476
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:52,715
If you'll not open this door,
we shall take this castle by force!

477
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:56,715
In the name of God and the glory of <i>our...</i>

478
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:00,914
Right! That settles it!

479
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:04,672
Depart at this time,
and don't be approaching any more...

480
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:09,276
...or we fire arrows into your heads,
and make castanets out of your testicles.

481
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:10,918
Walk away, just ignore them.

482
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:14,754
And now remain gone,
illegitimate. Faced bugger. Folk!

483
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:19,351
And, if you think you got a nasty
taunting this time, you ain't heard...

484
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:22,830
...nothing yet, dirty English knights!

485
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:46,758
. We shall attack at once.
. Yes, my liege.

486
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:48,717
Stand by for attack!

487
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:47,273
French persons!

488
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:51,789
Today the blood of many a valiant knight
shall be avenged.

489
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:55,517
In the name of God,
we shall not stop our fight...

490
00:39:55,640 --> 00:40:00,191
...till each one of you lies dead,
and the Holy Grail...

491
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:03,756
...returns to those whom God has chosen.

492
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:08,038
Charge!

493
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:34,949
Yes, they're the ones, I'm sure.

494
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:42,908
. Come on.
. Put this man in the van.

495
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:49,399
. Put him in the van.
. Get a blanket over that one.

496
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:52,108
Come on, back! Right back!

497
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:56,390
That's an offensive weapon, that is.

498
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:01,550
All right, sonny, that's enough.
Pack that in.
